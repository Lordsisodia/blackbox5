  Pre-tool hook system for Blackbox that provides context injection and validation
  capabilities before file operations. Hooks run automatically before Read/Write/Edit
  operations to provide additional context or validate changes.

  Components:
  - inject-context.sh: Walks up directory tree to find and inject AGENTS.md context
  - validate-changes.sh: Validates files for sensitive data, debug statements, TODOs

  Key capabilities:
  - Automatic context discovery from AGENTS.md files
  - Sensitive data pattern detection (passwords, API keys, secrets, tokens)
  - Debug statement detection (console.log, TODO/FIXME comments)
  - Pre-operation validation before Write/Edit
  - Multi-language support (JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Java, Go, Rust)
