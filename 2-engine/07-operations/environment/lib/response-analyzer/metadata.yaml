  Comprehensive response analysis system for Ralph Runtime enabling real-time
  evaluation of autonomous agent outputs. Provides pattern detection, quality scoring,
  expectation validation, task completion verification, confusion detection,
  confidence assessment, action recommendations, and trend analysis.

  Components:
  - ResponseAnalyzer: Core analysis with error detection and info extraction
  - RalphResponseAnalyzer: Ralph-specific with runtime recommendations
  - QualityScorer: Multi-dimensional quality scoring (completeness, accuracy, relevance, clarity)
  - PatternMatcher: Success, error, confusion, and completion pattern detection
  - ExpectationValidator: Validate against requirements and constraints

  Key capabilities:
  - Real-time response analysis
  - Error pattern detection
  - Information extraction (file paths, URLs, commands, code blocks)
  - Multi-dimensional quality scoring
  - Expectation comparison and validation
  - Task completion verification
  - Confusion detection
  - Confidence assessment
  - Action recommendations (CONTINUE, PAUSE_FOR_REVIEW, ERROR_RECOVERY, etc.)
  - Intervention need assessment
  - Trend analysis over time
