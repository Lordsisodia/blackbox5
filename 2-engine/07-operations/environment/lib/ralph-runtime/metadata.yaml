  Sophisticated autonomous execution engine for self-directing agents. Enables agents
  to plan, execute, monitor, and recover from errors with minimal human intervention.
  Provides AI-powered decision making, confidence scoring, learning from feedback,
  and smart human escalation when intervention is needed.

  Key capabilities:
  - Autonomous task execution with self-directing agents
  - Progress monitoring with milestone management
  - Intelligent error detection, classification, and recovery
  - AI-powered decision making with confidence scoring
  - Learning from feedback to improve over time
  - Smart human escalation when needed
  - State persistence for resumability
  - Context variable management
