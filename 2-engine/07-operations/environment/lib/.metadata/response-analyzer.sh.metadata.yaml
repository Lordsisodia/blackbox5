  Response analysis and progress tracking for autonomous agent execution. Part of
  the Circuit Breaker implementation, this script analyzes AI responses for
  completion indicators, extracts metrics, and tracks progress over time.

  Key capabilities:
  - Analyze AI responses for completion indicators
  - Extract completion score (0-100) from fix plan
  - Extract confidence levels from responses
  - Count and categorize errors
  - Generate response metrics (completion, confidence, errors, length)
  - Track progress in markdown format
  - Integration with circuit-breaker and fix plan files

  Analysis outputs:
  - Completion score: Based on task checklist completion
  - Confidence score: Extracted from AI responses
  - Error count: Categorized error patterns
  - Response metrics: JSON with all analysis data
