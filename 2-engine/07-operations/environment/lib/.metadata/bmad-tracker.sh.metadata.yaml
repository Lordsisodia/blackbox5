  - Build: Architecture design, implementation, development
  - Measure: Testing, validation, metrics collection
  - Refine: Optimization, iteration, improvement

  Key capabilities:
  - Phase validation and progression
  - Completion criteria checking per phase
  - State persistence in JSON
  - Phase descriptions and criteria
  - Bash 3.2 compatible for macOS
  - Integration with planning system
