  Comprehensive Python library for creating, managing, and validating structured
  specifications in Blackbox4. Inspired by GitHub Spec Kit workflows and integrated
  with Phase 1 (Context Variables) and Phase 2 (Hierarchical Tasks). Provides
  structured data models, sequential questioning, multi-format output, comprehensive
  validation, and PRD templates for different project types.

  Components:
  - StructuredSpec: Main specification container
  - UserStory: User stories with acceptance criteria
  - FunctionalRequirement: Requirements with dependencies
  - ProjectConstitution: Vision, tech stack, quality standards
  - QuestioningEngine: Gap analysis and question generation
  - SequentialQuestioner: Advanced adaptive questioning
  - SpecValidator: Comprehensive validation and cross-artifact checking
  - PRDTemplate: Multiple project type templates

  Key capabilities:
  - Structured data models for specs, stories, requirements, constitutions
  - Sequential questioning with gap analysis
  - Multi-format output (PRD markdown, JSON)
  - Comprehensive validation
  - Cross-artifact validation
  - PRD templates for web, mobile, API, library, system projects
  - Traceability checking
  - Inconsistency detection
