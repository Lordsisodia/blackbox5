## 🔍 Previous (Incorrect) Locations

These were created but are NOT the primary project memory:

❌ `.blackbox5/engine/memory/memory-bank/` - This is engine-level memory, not project memory
❌ `.serena/memories/` - This is Serena's project memory system, not Black Box

✅ `.blackbox5/5-project-memory/` - **CORRECT LOCATION**

---

## 📝 Memory System Comparison

| System | Location | Purpose | Status |
|--------|----------|---------|--------|
| **Black Box 5 Project Memory** | `.blackbox5/5-project-memory/` | Primary project memory | ✅ CORRECT |
| Black Box 5 Engine Memory | `.blackbox5/engine/memory/memory-bank/` | Engine-level operations | ⚠️ Wrong location |
| Serena Memory | `.serena/memories/` | Serena project system | ⚠️ Different system |

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. ✅ Project memory initialized
2. ✅ Action plan in correct location
3. ✅ Project context and metadata created
4. **NEXT:** Execute action plan using multi-agent delegation
