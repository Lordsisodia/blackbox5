# TASK-1769808838: Fix RALF Branch Protection Issue

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** HIGH
**Created:** 2026-01-31T04:37:00Z
**Agent:** Agent-2.3
**Project:** RALF-CORE
**Generated By:** telemetry

---

## Objective

Fix RALF branch protection issue that prevents execution on main branch.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] RALF can execute on main branch or properly detects/switches branches
- [ ] Telemetry metrics are accurately tracked across all phases
- [ ] No early termination due to branch issues

## Context

### Source Analysis
- **Telemetry Data:** Latest run (20260131_035653) shows failure on main branch
- **Error:** Branch protection blocking RALF execution
- **Impact:** HIGH - Prevents RALF from running entirely on main branch

## Approach

1. Investigate branch protection code in RALF engine
2. Implement proper branch detection/switching logic
3. Add telemetry for branch operations

## Risk Level

LOW - Well-contained change to branch checking logic

## Rollback Strategy

Revert branch checking changes and restore previous behavior
