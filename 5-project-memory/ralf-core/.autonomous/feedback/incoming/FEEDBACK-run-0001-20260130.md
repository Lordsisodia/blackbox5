# Shell Scripts Lack Dry-Run Mode

## Observation

None of the shell scripts in `engine/shell/` support a `--dry-run` flag. This makes it difficult to safely test changes without risking actual execution.

Scripts reviewed:
- `ralf-loop.sh` - Main daemon loop
- `telemetry.sh` - Telemetry collection
- `validate.sh` - Validation utilities
- `task` - Task management
- `test-run.sh` - Test execution
- `legacy-loop.sh` - Legacy loop

## Context

During testing strategy design, realized that safe testing requires being able to see what a script would do without it actually doing it. This is especially important for RALF which may run autonomously.

## Suggestion

1. Create a common dry-run library in `engine/lib/dry_run.sh`
2. Add `--dry-run` flag to all shell scripts
3. Create a test script that validates dry-run mode works

## Impact

High - Enables safe testing and reduces risk of accidental changes during RALF runs.
