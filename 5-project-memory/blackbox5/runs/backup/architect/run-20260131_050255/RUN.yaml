  ### Initial Analysis
  
  Research revealed that the Ralph agent directory structure existed but was empty - no manifest.json, no system directory. The task was to create the master system prompt that defines Ralph's autonomous loop behavior.
  
  ### Key Decisions
  
  1. **Prompt Structure:** Followed PLAN-011 specifications for 8 required sections
  2. **Ralph Technique Principles:** Incorporated all 5 core principles from the original Ralph Technique
  3. **Ralphy Patterns:** Integrated git worktree pattern as a future enhancement
  4. **Blackbox5 Integration:** Connected to existing project memory system, routes, and run tracking
  
  ### Implementation Approach
  
  - Created `system/` directory (was missing)
  - Wrote comprehensive 517-line prompt covering all requirements
  - Validated all 8 required sections are present
  - Validated all 5 Ralph Technique principles are covered
  - Validated exit conditions (PROMISE_COMPLETE) are defined
  - Validated integration points (project memory, fix_plan.md) are documented
  
  ### Key Insights
  
  1. **The Ralph loop is simple:** `while true; do cat prompt.md | claude; done`
  2. **One task per loop is critical** - prevents context bloat and ensures clean state
  3. **Sub-agents for preservation** - keeps main context clean for implementation
  4. **Exit conditions are mandatory** - prevents infinite loops
  5. **Progress tracking is structural** - fix_plan.md, prd.json, progress.json
  
  ### Success Validation
  
  All success criteria from TASK-1769809124 are met:
  - [x] Master prompt file created at specified path
  - [x] Prompt implements Ralph loop logic (one task per loop, context preservation, fix_plan.md tracking)
  - [x] Exit conditions properly defined ("PROMISE_COMPLETE" response)
  - [x] Integration with Blackbox5 task management system documented
  - [x] No placeholders - prompt is complete and functional

    **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
    
    All success criteria have been met. The Ralph master system prompt is:
    - Complete (all required sections present)
    - Functional (no placeholders, actionable content)
    - Integrated (connected to Blackbox5 systems)
    - Validated (all principles and requirements verified)
    
    The prompt is ready for use in autonomous Ralph loop execution.
