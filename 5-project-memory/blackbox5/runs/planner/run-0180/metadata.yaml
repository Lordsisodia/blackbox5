questions_answered:
  - question: "What is the core goal of BlackBox5?"
    answer: "Enable RALF to deliver features autonomously to production"
  - question: "What has been accomplished in the last 10 loops?"
    answer: "4 features delivered (F-001, F-005, F-006, F-007), 6 infrastructure tasks completed"
  - question: "What is blocking progress?"
    answer: "Nothing immediate (features delivering at 100% success), but queue automation is broken"
  - question: "What would have the highest impact right now?"
    answer: "Fix queue automation (systemic impact on all task completions)"

  Loop 180 Summary: Data Analysis + Queue Depth Assessment

  Key Findings:
  - Feature pipeline: 10/10 (100% success, 10 min/feature) ✅
  - Queue automation: 0/10 (0% success rate, broken since Run 52) ❌
  - System health: 7.6/10 (dragged down by queue failure)
  - Documentation: 10/10 (147 THOUGHTS.md, 140 DECISIONS.md) ✅

  Actions:
  - Analyzed last 10 runs for patterns (duration, success rate, queue failure)
  - Calculated system health (7 component scores)
  - Identified queue automation as highest priority fix (score 9.0)
  - Created F-009 task (Fix Queue Sync Automation)
  - Updated queue state (2 → 3 tasks, at target)

  Decisions:
  1. CREATE F-009 (Fix Queue Sync) - CRITICAL priority (score 9.0)
  2. DON'T create F-010 (next feature) - queue at target (3/3-5 tasks)
  3. DON'T interrupt F-004 - pipeline healthy, no blockers

  Queue State:
  - Depth: 3 tasks (F-009, F-004, F-008) - AT TARGET ✅
  - F-009: Fix queue automation (CRITICAL, score 9.0)
  - F-004: Automated testing (HIGH, score 7.0, in progress)
  - F-008: Real-time dashboard (MEDIUM, score 4.0)

  Expected Outcome (Next Loop):
  - F-004 completes (should be done soon)
  - F-009 claims next (highest priority)
  - Queue sync fixed (0% → 100% success rate)
  - System health improves (7.6/10 → 8.5/10)

  Validation:
  - All analysis backed by data (10 runs analyzed)
  - All decisions evidence-based (100% queue failure rate)
  - All priorities calculated (ROI: 9 completions break-even)
  - No duplicate work (F-009 != Run 52, different scope)

  Duration: 15 minutes (deep analysis required)
