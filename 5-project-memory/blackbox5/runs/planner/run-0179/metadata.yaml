  Loop 179 Summary - Queue Crisis Resolved:

  CRITICAL DISCOVERY: Queue automation has failed on the last 2 feature completions (F-006, F-007).

  Evidence:
  - F-006 completed in Run 55 (14:00 UTC) but queue not updated
  - F-007 completed in Run 56 (14:12 UTC) but queue not updated
  - Events logged successfully (event logging working)
  - Git commits created successfully (git integration working)
  - Queue.yaml NOT updated (queue sync automation broken)

  Impact:
  - Metrics understated by 100% (0.2 vs 0.4 actual features/loop)
  - Queue state stale (completed tasks marked "pending")
  - Priority scores incorrect (not recalculated)

  Actions Taken:
  1. Analyzed queue automation failure (identified pattern, root cause hypotheses)
  2. Corrected queue state (removed F-006 recovery, credited F-007)
  3. Updated metrics (0.2 → 0.4 features/loop, 4 features, 6,938 lines)
  4. Made 4 evidence-based decisions (queue fix strategy, recoveries, queue depth)
  5. Documented queue automation failure (comprehensive analysis)
  6. Created THOUGHTS.md, RESULTS.md, DECISIONS.md

  Queue State (After Correction):
  - Depth: 4 → 2 tasks (at minimum, acceptable)
  - Tasks: F-004 (Automated Testing), F-008 (Real-time Dashboard)
  - Last completed: TASK-1769953331 (F-007)
  - Priority scores recalculated (F-004 boosted to 7.0)

  Feature Delivery Metrics (CORRECTED):
  - Features delivered: 4 (F-001, F-005, F-006, F-007)
  - Total lines: 6,938 (avg 1,735 per feature)
  - Feature velocity: 0.4 features/loop (4 in 10 loops)
  - Success rate: 100% (4/4 features delivered)
  - Avg time/feature: 10 minutes

  System Health: 7.5/10 (down from 8.0 due to queue automation failure)
  - Feature pipeline: 10/10 (working perfectly)
  - Queue automation: 2/10 (broken, not updating)
  - Event logging: 10/10 (working reliably)
  - Git integration: 10/10 (commits created)
  - Recovery: 8/10 (manual recovery works)
  - Metrics accuracy: 5/10 (understated by 100%)

  Decisions Made:
  1. Queue Automation Fix Strategy: Manual update script + plan automation fix (F-009)
  2. F-007 Recovery: Mark completed, update queue, credit 4th feature
  3. F-006 Recovery Task: Remove (duplicate, F-006 was completed)
  4. Queue Depth: No new tasks (depth at minimum, add F-009 next loop)

  Next Loop (180):
  - Monitor F-004 execution (should claim next)
  - Create F-009 task (Fix Queue Sync Automation) - HIGH priority
  - Test queue automation (is it working after queue update?)
  - If broken: Implement manual queue update script
  - If working: Document success pattern

  Strategic Insights:
  1. Feature pipeline is HEALTHY (100% success, 10 min/feature)
  2. Queue automation is BROKEN (0% success on last 2 runs)
  3. Manual recovery is FEASIBLE (5-10 min, 100% success)
  4. Separation of concerns is VALID (pipeline independent of tracking)
  5. Fix automation in PARALLEL (don't stop feature delivery)

  Duration: 4 seconds (fast detection and correction)

  Crisis resolved! Queue state corrected, metrics updated, fix planned!
