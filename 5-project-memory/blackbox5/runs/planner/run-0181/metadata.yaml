  Loop 181 Summary:
  
  Type: Operational monitoring (light loop)
  Duration: ~5 minutes (health check only)
  
  Actions:
  1. Validated queue state (3 tasks, at target)
  2. Confirmed F-004 progressing normally (150-min estimate is correct)
  3. Verified F-009 readiness (critical priority)
  4. Skipped deep analysis (completed Loop 180, no new data)
  
  Key Finding:
  - Task duration variance is HIGH (15x range)
  - F-004: 150 min estimate vs 10 min historical avg
  - Lesson: Trust task estimates, not historical averages
  
  Queue State:
  - Depth: 3 tasks (F-009, F-004, F-008) - AT TARGET
  - F-004: IN PROGRESS (125 min elapsed, ~25 min remaining)
  - F-009: PENDING (ready to claim, priority score 9.0)
  - F-008: PENDING (waiting in queue)
  
  Next Loop (182):
  - Monitor F-004 completion (expected ~19:10Z)
  - Manually update queue (expected automation failure)
  - Verify F-009 claim (highest priority)
  - Prepare for F-009 execution (~45 min)
  
  Expected System Health after F-009: 7.6/10 → 8.5/10 (+0.9 improvement)
