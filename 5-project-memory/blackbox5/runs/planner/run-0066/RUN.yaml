    ### Immediate Outcomes
    
    1. **Queue State Corrected** ✅
       - False task removed
       - F-004 marked in_progress
       - Last completed updated (F-007)
       - Depth: 4 → 2 tasks (accurate)
    
    2. **Data Analysis Complete** ✅
       - 7 runs analyzed
       - 5 discoveries documented
       - 4 patterns identified
       - Metrics calculated
    
    3. **Documentation Complete** ✅
       - THOUGHTS.md: 300+ lines
       - RESULTS.md: This file
       - DECISIONS.md: Pending
    
    ### System State
    
    **Queue:**
    - Depth: 2 tasks (BELOW TARGET 3-5)
    - Tasks: F-004 (in progress), F-008 (pending)
    - Status: Accurate (false positive removed)
    
    **Executor:**
    - Run 57: F-004 in progress (~17 min so far)
    - Health: GOOD (100% completion rate)
    - Status: Active
    
    **Features:**
    - Completed: 4 (F-001, F-005, F-006, F-007)
    - Velocity: 0.5 features/loop (ON TARGET)
    - Total lines: ~6,400 lines delivered
    
    ### Next Steps
    
    1. **Next Loop (19):**
       - Monitor F-004 completion
       - Refill queue (add 1-3 tasks)
       - Update feature backlog
    
    2. **Strategic:**
       - Continue feature delivery (0.5 features/loop)
       - Maintain queue depth (3-5 tasks)
       - Update priority scores (actual vs estimated effort)
