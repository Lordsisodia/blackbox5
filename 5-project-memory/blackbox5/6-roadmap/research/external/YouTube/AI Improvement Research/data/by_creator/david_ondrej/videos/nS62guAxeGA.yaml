  full_text: Building an AI SAS is one of the best ways to make money in 2026. And
    in this video, I'm going to show you everything you need to know to build one.
    From selecting the idea to AI tools to backend deployment, tech stack, payments,
    testing, authentication, and much much more. So, if you are serious about making
    money with AI, make sure to watch until the end. First off, let's talk about selecting
    the idea because if you choose the bad idea, everything else is not going to matter.
    So, first off, you need to build a painkiller, not a vitamin. Many of you are
    building a vitamin, something that people don't really need. You need to find
    a real pain, a real problem and deliver the painkiller. Also, choose an industry
    where you have expertise. Don't go somewhere where you're completely clueless.
    Use any advantage you have. And please avoid mainstream stuff like Tinder butt
    for or AI trading bot or poly market arbitrage agent. Please avoid all that stuff.
    And in terms of where to look for ideas, you can go to Reddit and look for issues
    people have with existing softwares. You can look at what type of companies Y
    Combinator is funding. You can go on Twitter or X and look what's happening there.
    or you just can get a divine revelation and get the idea while you sleep. Next
    thing we need to look at is which AI tools to use. First of all, cloth code or
    open code for coding, right? You need an autonomous AI agent and these two are
    the best right now. Then you need an IDE. So we're going to use cursor or VS code.
    Then CEX. This is also another coding agent. But Codex is exceptionally good for
    debugging. It's way less lazy than cloud code. So definitely use Codex. Agent
    Zero for all kinds of manual tasks. You need to turn the logo into a favicon.
    You need to convert files. You need to do some data analysis. Agent Zero will
    do it instantly. Perplexity for web search and deep research. Fireflies for meeting
    transcription when you're doing customer calls, stuff like that. And then you
    want something in your CI/CD for preventing bugs. So either Code Rabbit or Bugbot,
    these are the AI tools you need. You don't need more. A lot of you are over complicating
    your AI stack. Keep it simple and just master a few AI tools. Speaking of stacks,
    let's look at the tech stack. Right? So this is probably one of the most important
    points. Sometimes this doesn't apply for 100% of AI SAS, but for most of them,
    you're going to go with this, right? So let's look at front end. We're going with
    Nex.js. Very popular framework, fast improving, and has basically everything you
    need. Tailwind CSS for the styling and chats and UI for pre-built UI components.
    So you can build even faster for inference where you run inference of AI models.
    Open router you can have everything there. Literally all of the models that you
    can imagine are available on open router. So you just integrate this and you can
    easily switch between models in your AI SAS or if you want more privacy focused
    approach. Venice AI is great. They're focused on unbiased AI and private AI. They're
    not collecting your data stuff like that. So these two are the only two inference
    providers you really need in terms of back end.js Python with fast API like these
    are the two mainstream text tags. Again, don't choose a text stack that's like
    esoteric, that's, you know, random, new. No, choose something that's super popular.
    As you can notice, Nex.js, Python, like these are all mainstream, right? The reason
    for that is there's a lot of training data in the AI models. So, the models can
    help you a lot. So, keep it simple. Don't overengineer your tech stack. Same with
    the database. Just stick to SQL, Postgress, that's all you need. If you want something
    faster, Reddis cache is great. If you're not a senior developer with 10 plus years
    of experience, you're going to shoot yourself in the foot and you're going to
    waste so much time compared to if you just went with a popular proven tech stack.
    Next up is learning. Because if you want to build an AI SAS, you need to learn
    stuff every single day. So, first of all, deep research, right? Doesn't matter
    if it's perplexity, cloth, Gemini. Use some sort of deep research to understand
    different topics. Next up, GBD 5.2 Pro. When something is very complex, includes
    a lot of details, a lot of nuance, take a few minutes to describe a great prompt,
    send it to GB 5.2 Pro and you're going to learn a lot. And lastly, just subscribe
    to my channel. It's completely free and I make videos on the cutting edge AI tools.
    And in 2026, you need to master AI agents to stay ahead. So, make sure to subscribe
    to not miss any videos. Next, let's talk about the AI models themselves. So, right
    now, obviously, this is changing every month. But right now, Opus 4.5 is coded.
    It's the best model basically for anything, but it's more expensive, right? So,
    these are the models to building. But if you are talking about using your app,
    Gemini free flash is great in the app, right? So, if you want cheap inference,
    Gemini free flash. If you want something to build a front end with, Gemini free
    pro is great. But in terms of development, Opus 4.5 basically for everything.
    GBD 5.2 CX for debugging. And then GLM 4.7. If you want to use an open source
    model, maybe you want to fine tune it, you have a large data set like that, then
    GLM4.7 is right now probably the best open source AI model. And again, you don't
    need to overthink this. You don't need to be using 10 different models. Just use
    these. Trust me. Next up, we need to talk about GitHub because GitHub is like
    one of the most essential softwares you need to master. And a lot of you are scared
    about it for no reason, right? So, first of all, GitHub is the place where your
    code is stored. This makes deployment easy. Every platform integrates with GitHub.
    Instead of having a project on a your local machine and then you send somebody
    like a zip file, terrible. Never ever do that. You learn how to deploy on GitHub.
    Again, takes a few minutes to learn and it's a skill you're going to have forever.
    Also, you need to have a different main branch and dev branch, right? I know it's
    tempting to push straight into production, but if you want to build a serious
    ASIS, you should have a separate dev environment or a staging environment, but
    keep it simple. Also, you can use GitHub for your CI/CD. Yeah, GitHub workflows
    is great. Everything integrates with it. So, if you master GitHub and if you use
    GitHub, it's going to give you a lot and it's going to simplify a lot of complexity
    that comes with building ASAs. And by the way, guys, we're just getting started.
    These were only three or four points from this whole video. As you can see, this
    is very in-depth and there are so many gems and nuggets in this video. Honestly,
    I should have charged money for this. So, if you really do watch until the end,
    you're going to have so much clarity on what to do to build your ASAS. Next up,
    we need to talk about distribution because this is something that a lot of you
    guys are not doing enough. When you use AI, you can build super fast. You can
    add new features. You can improve the product. But to build a successful AI app,
    you need distribution. You need to do some marketing. You need to do some promotion.
    And you can do this and you should do this even before launching. A lot of you
    guys are waiting until the MVP is finished and then later I'm going to do you
    know promotion. I'm going to try to get customers. No, your biggest issue from
    day one of any business is not having customers. Now sometimes you might need
    to get an MVP up and running. You might need to have some sort of product. But
    you can promote even before you have everything ready. And there's two ways. Number
    one is weight list. You can create a free weight list where you collect their
    first name, last name, email, and phone number to get early access to the product.
    Second thing is a pre-sale. You can legit start collecting money before you launch.
    How, you might ask? You need to make a great offer. You need to give them either
    percentage off or some bonus personalized onboarding, some reason to pay you even
    before the launch. And you can do the launch in 30 days or 60 days, whatever,
    right? But you need to start promoting and distributing before the launch. And
    also, you should spend at least two hours a day on this. Yes, I don't care who
    you are. I don't care if you have 17 kids. I don't care about anything. If you
    have a full-time job, if you are able to allocate 4 hours a day to building your
    ASAs, at least 50% of your time should be on distribution. It should be on making
    content, uploading to YouTube, calls, DMing potential customers, actual distribution,
    not researching, not preparing, taking action, posting, uploading. Next up, focus
    on one channel. Do not do YouTube, Instagram, Tik Tok, LinkedIn, blah blah blah.
    No, one channel could be called DM. Just do call DM. Could be just YouTube long
    firm. do just YouTube long firm could be a LinkedIn articles do just LinkedIn
    articles but choose one customer acquisition channel and master that channel it's
    significantly more different if you have if you're doing five different things
    on five different platforms each platform has a different algorithm each format
    is different not do all of them choose one master it stick with it and choose
    the one where your target avatar is located right so if you're trying to target
    lawyers probably don't make Tik Tok videos probably just do LinkedIn where your
    target avatar spends time on YouTube that's where you should be distributing ing
    and promoting. Next up, give value and not self-promo. A lot of you guys when
    you get into distribution marketing, you make some content, you talk about your
    features, you talk about your product. Nobody cares about your product. Nobody
    knows your product exists. Okay? You need to give value. Talk about biggest mistakes
    in your industry or how to, you know, how to tutorials or anything and then use
    your product in your videos. Don't do self-promo is like here's why my is that
    is the best or new feature in XY Z. Nobody cares about your app. Nobody cares
    about your features. Nobody knows you. You need to give value. Make a valuable
    content that people genuinely get value from and then promote your software, your
    SAS. And this is more important than building. Like literally, if you just take
    this to heart, please realize that spending time on distribution should be done
    first. Your first 60 minutes of the day, if you're building an AI SAS, should
    be on distribution, creating content, trying to get customers. It's more important
    than building. And most of you are going to completely ignore this and you're
    just going to keep vibe coding with cloth. Few of you are going to listen to this
    and those are the people who are actually going to make money. Okay, next up,
    let's talk about deployments. Keep it super simple, guys. Don't use containerized
    packages with Azure. Oh my god, so many of you are overengineering your deployments
    and you're building like big tech. You are not big tech. You're not making tens
    of billions of dollars per year. You are struggling to get customers. You are
    a startup. You need to move fast. So, keep it simple. Versel for the front end,
    render.com for the back end, Superbase for the database, Railway has a lot of
    great services. If you don't like Render or something, use Railway. And Hostinger
    has amazing VPS servers. If you want to use VPS for example with dock ploy or
    you just want to host anything on a server use hostinger. So these are the deployments.
    If you're over complicating it if you're using AWS like why do you have millions
    of customers? Do you have scalability issues? Keep it simple guys. Don't overthink
    this or on a virgin. The simpler the better. It almost never is an issue that
    people choose on these platforms outscale it. If you do that's amazing problem
    you have great like you're 0.01% successful if you outscale any of these platforms.
    But for most of you keep it simple. All right. Next up, we are going to talk about
    payments because without payments, you're not going to make any money. So, first
    of all, don't use stripe. Why? Even though Stripe is easy and proven blah blah
    blah, Stripe is not a merchant of record. So, I've I put three alternatives here.
    Polar, lemon squeezy, and parallel. These act as a merchant of record. So, let
    me explain this. And I made this mistake with vectal and it cost me like over
    a month of development cost to switch from stripe to Polar. But guys, just save
    yourself that time and don't make the same mistake as as me. You need to have
    merchant of records. What this means is that these companies, they legally own
    the transaction and handle all of the global tax compliance, VAT, GST filing,
    sales tax remittance across 150 plus different jurisdictions. If you're building
    a SAS, you're going to have customers from Europe, from South America, from North
    America, from Asia, maybe from Africa, but whatever. You get the point. You're
    going to have customers from 50 plus 100 plus countries. And each of these countries
    have different laws, different regulations, different uh, you know, VAT, all that
    stuff. You are going to drown in legal processes and in accounting if you want
    to do that manually, which you have to do manually if you're using Stripe. This
    is why you need a merchant of record. So, choose one of these three. These companies
    uh charge slightly higher fees than than Stripe, sometimes not even, and they
    integrate with Stripe, so it's easy to switch and they handle all of this for
    you. And you never have to worry about getting into trouble with German VAT tax
    because you are not on the customer's card. It is parallel squeezy or polar. So
    use merch of record. Trust me, you're going to save yourself so much headache,
    so much pain. This is one of the most common mistakes that people make when building
    a SAS. Related to payments is pricing. So let's talk about pricing. There we go.
    A lot of you are charging too little. That's simply the truth. you need to probably
    charge more and you need to keep your profit margins between 70 and 95%. Because
    otherwise you're going to get eaten by API costs. How do you charge more? Well,
    you make a better offer. So, first of all, read this book from Alexi. Absolute
    bible of business. Takes like one or two days to read. Super concise, super distilled.
    Just read it, okay? It's you got to find it online for free. He made this as cheap
    as possible. Next up, you need to, you know, once you improve your offer and you
    charge more, you want to sell to annual and two-year plans. Do not go for monthly
    plans right away, guys. Let's say you you're charging $30 a month, right? Times
    12, that would be 360. But obviously, the annual plan is some discount, so that
    could be 300. $300 a month allows you to do so much more. You can run paid ads.
    If you run paid ads and it takes you $200 to acquire a customer, which in a lot
    of industries that would be realistic, then guess what? On day one, you're profiting
    100. If for the same product you run paid ads, but you're going for monthly and
    it cost you $100 because it's the same product, it's going to cost you the same
    to acquire the customer and you're charging $30 a month. You're literally going
    to take four months to be profitable. That will make scaling way, way harder.
    And if you have high churn, you won't even get the customer for four months and
    you're going to lose money. So go with annual and two-year plans and make them
    more more appealing. Include personalized onboarding. If somebody buys an annual
    plan or two-year plan, just make the offer better and charge more money. Also,
    go high ticket possible. A lot of people don't realize you can build high ticket
    software. You don't have to charge $10 a month, $20 a month. You are not JPD,
    okay? You're not going to reach 1 billion weekly active users. So go high ticket,
    target businesses, go B2B, solve a painful problem for rich people or wealthy
    companies and charge thousands of dollars for that. You can sell software that
    is still replicable and sellable to others. I'm not talking about building agency,
    guys. That's terrible. You shouldn't do like a one-off project. You want to keep
    building something that can scale that you can sell eventually for a lot of money
    like I did with Vectal. So you need to figure out what is something that I could
    sell to businesses or wealthy individuals that I can charge four figures for or
    even five figures for that I can resell to others. Maybe you do a license, you
    know, maybe you you give them an exclusivity only in their country or in or region,
    whatever, right? Get creative with it. Make the offerboard peeling and target
    B2B if possible. Don't just make a B2C product like everybody charging $20 a month.
    It's ruthless. It's very difficult and you're going to probably lose your hair.
    Now, all of this assumes that you already know AI coding. But if you're not into
    AI coding and you want to master it, make sure to join the new society. This is
    my community where I'm going to teach you everything you need to know about how
    to build software with AI. Close code, codeex, cursor, everything is inside. If
    you join your society within two months, you're going to be an expert of AI coder.
    This is going to be linked below the video. Make sure to join. If you don't like
    it, we have a no question money back guarantee. So, literally just DM me. I'm
    going to refund your money. This is not my main source of income. Trust me. Next
    up, we have authentication. Where is it? There you go. Authentication right here.
    So with authentication, literally do not over complicate it, please. If you're
    using superbase for your database, just use superbase off. That's it. If you're
    not using superbase, use clerk, right? Clerk has everything you need. This is
    it. cleric.com with an e. It has u it's like more than authentication, you know,
    user management as well, but uh it has great authentication, lots of documentation
    for all different SDKs and text stacks. So yeah, Cleric is infinitely scalable.
    But if you want to keep it even simpler, just stick to superbase authentication.
    Don't over complicate this. If you're using AI for coding, you really don't want
    to risk having a complex authentication, right? Because uh otherwise you're asking
    for security issues. Next essential thing that a lot of you are skipping is analytics.
    A lot of AI SAS people especially in the first 3 to six months have zero observability,
    zero analytics, zero product metrics, which is absolutely crazy because you cannot
    make datadriven decisions. Now, I know you might thinking, "Okay, David, like
    what is this data driven decisions? I'm not big tech." There is a reason this
    term exists. Why? Because you use data to make rational and smart decisions. If
    you don't have any data, you don't know which feature to remove or keep. You don't
    know what product direction to take. You don't know what cohort of your audience
    you should target and market to. You need data. You need analytics. So, here's
    three things, right? Post hog is for product metrics. So, you know, which features
    being used, where are people clicking, stuff like that. session times, retention.
    Sentry is more for like errors and bugs. Um, so these two we use advoc as well.
    But if you want something LLM like observability of your AI agents and you know
    tokens, lang fuse is great. So these three for analytics, make sure to start tracking
    without any metrics, you cannot improve. So if you want to lower your churn, you
    need to track it properly. If you want to improve session times, you need to measure
    them properly. And this is where analytics come into place. Next up, let's talk
    about prompt engineering and context engineering. A lot of your prompts suck completely.
    you don't give the AI agents enough context and then your AI SAS is bad. Right?
    Now, let me debunk something. There's this concept of a LLM rapper. Like, oh,
    your app is just a rapper. Guys, there's going to be rappers and there already
    are rappers that are making millions and billions. If you make a rapper good enough
    for specific specific target avatar, you're going to print. Let me give you an
    example. in before even change video was released. I think it was like 20 22 23
    uh people have built man I let me find the company name. Okay, I found it. So
    this is called case text. They literally built a AI assistant for legal assistance
    before they got access to GBD4 before it was released. But basically this is a
    rapper. They took GBD4, made it relevant to legal assistant co- councils and sold
    to $650 million in cash. Right? So this is not equity. This is not some hypothetical
    uh stock options. This is cold hard cash in the bank account, right? So literally
    GBD4 and GBD4 is much worse than current models. And this is a rapper. It's a
    rapper and uh he got rich by building a rapper. So yeah, you can absolutely your
    ASASS is going to be some sort of a wrapper. Obviously, you probably want to have
    a custom UI and other features as well, but how good your wrapper depends on your
    prompts and your context engineering. So make sure to use XML tags at the beginning
    and at the end of different sections. Make sure you have a agents.md file in the
    root of your codebase so that cloth code, open code, codeex, these agents are
    as good as possible. If you don't, you can just do the slashinit command in clo
    code or open code and it will generate the file for you because it will analyze
    your entire codebase and craft the file for you. But don't sleep on the importance
    of great problems. There's plenty of startups that have made a lot of money by
    taking popular AI models either from OpenAI and from Google and just making them
    highly optimized for a specific target avatar and making the best possible app
    for that avatar. lock in about your context engineering. Don't sleep on this.
    It's very important. Next up, let's talk about operations when you're building,
    right? So, you need to be using some sort of task management, project management.
    If you have a big company, like you can use Jira and stuff like that, but for
    smaller companies, these three are better. So, linear is basically like a canv
    board for developers. They have a list view as well, but the list view is kind
    of bad. GitHub projects is super simple. So, if you're already using GitHub, you
    can just use the project inside of GitHub. That's what I used to do for a long
    time at Vectal. But then we added a vectoral ability to share your project. So
    obviously if you prefer like a simpler solution with built-in AI, then you can
    use vectal as well for your operations and task management. But you need to use
    something. You cannot just be yoloing actions one day at a time. You need to have
    a clear task list. You need to prioritize what features you add, what changes
    you make. So yeah, again, keep your operation simple. Use one of these three softwares.
    Now let's talk about the biggest mistakes. And this might be guys, I know we covered
    a lot, but this might be the most valuable part of the video. Biggest mistakes
    people make when building an ASAS. First of all, do not get married to your idea.
    You don't know if your idea is good until it prints you money. If it prints you
    money, your idea is good before. Then don't get married to it. Don't get emotionally
    attached to it. Okay? You and your idea are not the same thing. If your idea sucks,
    that doesn't mean that you suck. You just had a bad idea. Everybody had a bad
    idea in their life. Okay? So, don't get married to it. Next biggest mistake is
    only building and not promoting. I already touched on that, but a lot of you are
    literally doing it as you watch. You are building something you think it's cool.
    You're not promoting it. You're not getting any real input from the market. You're
    you're going to learn a painful lesson sooner or later. Next biggest mistake is
    solving a problem others won't pay for. Maybe that problem is is still like valuable.
    Maybe people use it for free, but are they willing to pay for it? If they're not
    willing to pay for it, you don't have a business on your hand. Next thing, oh
    my god, this is so common. Targeting everybody. David, but my app could be used
    by anyone. Listen, dumbass. That's amazing in theory, but it's terrible in practice.
    You don't know how to do your marketing. You You cannot do clear copyrightiting.
    Your landing page is going to be too broad and not specific enough. You don't
    know which features to add and which to remove because you're trying to target
    everybody. You are not GPT. You are not Google. Stop targeting everybody. Choose
    a clear target avatar. Go after a small niche and start there. If you dominate
    that small niche and if you create a monopoly there, you can expand. But before
    then, you are going to hurt yourself by trying to target everybody instead of
    going after a clear specific target avatar with a clear specific problem and solving
    that problem in a unique way better than everybody else. Next up, charging too
    liter. We already talked about it. You should probably increase your prices. Next
    up, next biggest mistake is taking forever to release. Guys, the amount of entrepreneurs
    and startup founders I know that are permanently two weeks away from launching
    is is amazing. Like there's literally people who I catch up with like two times
    a year, three times a year. And anytime I ask them like, "Yo, how's your company
    doing? How's how's your startup going?" They're always two weeks away from launching.
    It's incredible. So if you are one of these people, you can realize like you need
    to set a deadline and you just need to launch. I don't care if there's going to
    be bugs. I don't care if there's missing features. You need to release your product.
    Okay? Release your startup. Get it to the market as fast as possible. Otherwise,
    you might be building something that nobody wants. And the only way to know that
    is to release it to the market. Next up, choosing a dying market. Again, don't
    sell to newspapers. Don't sell to, you know, elevator operators. I mean, that's
    non-existent market, but it used to be existing market 100 years ago, but it doesn't
    exist anymore. So, make sure that whatever you're doing, you are in a growing
    industry, in a growing market, right? Very simple. But a lot of you again are
    selling to a dying market, which makes it much harder to grow. Next up, not using
    AI to learn. You can use AI obviously to build your code and that's the obvious
    thing that everybody's doing. But the best way to use AI is to improve yourself,
    is to speed up your learning, is to ask precise questions, do deep research and
    learn faster and become smarter and more competent yourself so that you can use
    the AI agents even more. And you have two exponentials, right? One exponential
    is AI getting better and better. And the second is your skill sets and your knowledge
    and your technical capability getting better and better and they compound. So
    if you do both, you're going to absolutely crush 2026. then overspending API cost.
    Again, don't um don't underestimate this, you know. Um if you have an app where
    you have generous limits, people can quickly spend a lot of money on your AI models.
    If you use expensive models like Opus, you need to monitor your costs very closely.
    So, make sure you keep your margins above 50%, ideally above 70% for your ASAs.
    Otherwise, you're probably overspending on API calls and you need to change the
    offer or improve it in some way or implement some cheaper models somewhere where
    you don't need the full capability. And next up, which all of you make and this
    is everybody will be guilty of this is feature bloat. MVP stands for minimal viable
    product. But a better term I like to use is a quick and dirty prototype. If your
    quick and dirty prototype has seven features, congratulations, you've overbloated
    it and you have feature blo. You need one or two features. That's it. If you have
    one or two features and they're good and you're going to launch, you're going
    to make money. If you have 20 features, you're not going to make 20 great features.
    It's already hard to make one great feature. Imagine 20. You're not going to do
    it. Avoid feature bloat. Most of features you have in your app right now are feature
    bloat and they should be removed. And it's very painful. The first time I realized
    that at Vectal, I was sick. I couldn't sleep for like two days. But then I deleted
    like 70% of the features and literally none none of the customers complained.
    So yeah, feature bloat is one of the biggest mistakes as well. And honestly, I'm
    probably leaving some stuff out, but these are the biggest mistakes that I see
    consistently from people when they try to build their first ASS. Now, let's talk
    about testers because if you don't have testers, u good luck. You're going to
    have a lot of mistakes. You're going to have bugs and u yeah, it's much easier
    to build when you have testers. So, first of all, when you're starting, you need
    to get resourceful, right? It's one of the main skills of being an entrepreneur.
    Resourcefulness. If you don't have a lot of resources, you need to be resourceful.
    So your family could be testers. Your friends could be testers. Your potential
    customers aka people who are your target avatar but aren't your customers. Those
    are amazing testers. You can do both technical and non techchnical to see, you
    know, how people use your app and where they get stuck. But the best thing is
    watch them in person. Don't just send them your app as a link. No, sit them down,
    put a laptop in front of them and watch them use it for the first time in person.
    This will give you priceless advice. It will show you where they get confused.
    It will show you what features are missing. It'll show you, you know, maybe the
    onboarding is too long, maybe something is like overly complicated. Yeah, it'll
    just show you a lot. You should do this. You should figure out how to do this
    every single week if you can. But yeah, you need testers before you release production.
    Otherwise, you're going to have a a lot of sleepless nights just fixing production
    bugs. So, make sure you have some testers. Next up, let's talk about terminal
    commands. Now, honestly, out of all of these, the only one you need is cloth.
    If you know how to use cloth code, and if you have cloud code installed, then
    you don't really have to interact with terminal that much. But if you're going
    to learn terminal commands, learn these. PWD, this shows you your um directory
    where it is located on your machine. LS shows you the list out files in this directory.
    CD, you can cd into a subdirectory or a directory. Basically, it's just changing
    where you are. Git add this is how you stage files. Git commit is how you do a
    commit and get push is you push to remote such as to GitHub. Then npm install
    is node package manager installs the dependencies. npm rundev runs the dev server.
    npm run build does a build uh production build. Git pull is how you pull updates
    on a branch. So when maybe somebody else is working there. But again all of these
    you're going to solve with AI. But you shouldn't be scared of the terminal. Okay?
    Like you should shouldn't turn into this guy either, but like you shouldn't be
    scared of the terminal. A lot of you guys think that terminal is like some mythical
    thing. It's not. If you learn how to use the terminal, you can move way faster.
    And again, this this is like less than 10 commands and this is really all you
    need. Like you don't need to learn hundreds of commands. Just learn the basic
    ones, understand what they do, and that's it. Like stop being afraid of the terminal.
    It's a limiting belief and it's a limiting your potential and you're going to
    make less money if you fear the terminal. Now, I don't know the last category,
    so I named it others because there's a bunch of different tips. But first of all,
    fair gates for onboarding is a great tool. If you don't have onboarding in your
    app, you're kind of trolling. Now, this just makes it onboarding easier. Obviously,
    you can build your own custom stuff, but you know, when people come into your
    app, it's it's going to show these like pop-ups next to features and yeah, it
    just makes onboarding easier easier. So, if you want, you can ask lot code and
    it will probably do it in a single prompt. But if you want something more pre-built,
    frigate is cool for that. Also, keep your landing page simple. Do not um over
    complicate it. Clearly explain what problem you're solving. Don't make it too
    long, okay? Make it easy to sign up. Put your sign up in the top right. Okay,
    guys. Don't put login and like don't don't try any esoteric layouts on the landing
    page. People expect to create an account in the top right. People expect the login
    to be in the top right. So please put it there top right in the banner always
    visible. Next up, your onboarding should be quick. It shouldn't take 10 minutes
    to onboard. People want to get into the app. So do the most essential things.
    And again, the best onboarding is them using the app. If you use Frigate, you
    can just have people use the app and click through it and get onboarded as they
    use the app instead of having to fill out questionnaire for 20 minutes and then
    they're annoyed at you and a lot of people are not going to even fill it out and
    you're going to be losing users. So, keep the onboarding quick and onboard people
    gradually. Also, make the plans upgrades easy. If you already have some free users
    and they're not converting, it's probably too difficult to upgrade. So, a free
    user should always have a banner at the top where they can upgrade with one click.
    There should be some features that are only available on the paid plan. Again,
    next to those features should be an upgrade button. Make it easy for people to
    upgrade. Also, create a terms of service and privacy privacy policy. Super simple.
    You can do it with AI. I'm not your legal advisor. Okay? This is not legal advice.
    So, definitely buy a lawyer. Do not use AI for this, you know. Don't use AI for
    this. Pay a professional lawyer. But no matter what you do, make sure you have
    terms of service and privacy policy. It's just sloppy not having it. You know,
    you need to have it legally. Next up, Stripe Atlas. If you want to set up a LLC,
    use Stripe Atlas to set it up. But if you don't have any paying customers and
    you have no users and no motion and no business experience, then probably that
    shouldn't be your first step. Again, I'm not your lawyer. Uh this is not legal
    advice. But if you do want to set up a LLC, Stripe Atlas makes it super easy.
    No matter where you live, you don't even have to go to the USA. It's uh the easiest
    way to start an LLC. So yeah, this has been everything you need to know to build
    an AI SAS in 2026. So hopefully you found this video valuable. If you did, make
    sure to subscribe. And if you want to actually turn this into real business model,
    make sure to join your society. In there, I show you everything you need to know
    about AI coding and how to actually go from an idea to a fully monetized AI SAS.
    The new society also gives you access to a community of 400 other people at the
    cutting edge of AI. You get weekly calls with AI experts. You get a classroom
    full of materials, copy pasteable prompts, templates, stuff that you can plug
    and play into your company right away. And if you actually watch these modules,
    you're going to go from a complete beginner with AI coding to someone who's better
    than 99% of people at building stuff with AI. So, join the new society. There's
    going to be a link below. With that being said, thank you guys for watching and
    I wish you a wonderful, productive week. See you.

    text: ways to make money in 2026. And in this
  - start: 00:00:03
    text: video, I'm going to show you everything
  - start: 00:00:05
    text: you need to know to build one. From
  - start: 00:00:07
    text: selecting the idea to AI tools to
  - start: 00:00:08
    text: backend deployment, tech stack,
  - start: 00:00:10
    text: payments, testing, authentication, and
  - start: 00:00:12
    text: much much more. So, if you are serious
  - start: 00:00:14
    text: about making money with AI, make sure to
  - start: 00:00:16
    text: watch until the end. First off, let's
  - start: 00:00:18
    text: talk about selecting the idea because if
  - start: 00:00:20
    text: you choose the bad idea, everything else
  - start: 00:00:22
    text: is not going to matter. So, first off,
  - start: 00:00:23
    text: you need to build a painkiller, not a
  - start: 00:00:24
    text: vitamin. Many of you are building a
  - start: 00:00:26
    text: vitamin, something that people don't
  - start: 00:00:27
    text: really need. You need to find a real
  - start: 00:00:28
    text: pain, a real problem and deliver the
  - start: 00:00:30
    text: painkiller. Also, choose an industry
  - start: 00:00:32
    text: where you have expertise. Don't go
  - start: 00:00:33
    text: somewhere where you're completely
  - start: 00:00:34
    text: clueless. Use any advantage you have.
  - start: 00:00:36
    text: And please avoid mainstream stuff like
  - start: 00:00:39
    text: Tinder butt for or AI trading bot or
  - start: 00:00:42
    text: poly market arbitrage agent. Please
  - start: 00:00:44
    text: avoid all that stuff. And in terms of
  - start: 00:00:45
    text: where to look for ideas, you can go to
  - start: 00:00:46
    text: Reddit and look for issues people have
  - start: 00:00:48
    text: with existing softwares. You can look at
  - start: 00:00:50
    text: what type of companies Y Combinator is
  - start: 00:00:51
    text: funding. You can go on Twitter or X and
  - start: 00:00:53
    text: look what's happening there. or you just
  - start: 00:00:55
    text: can get a divine revelation and get the
  - start: 00:00:57
    text: idea while you sleep. Next thing we need
  - start: 00:00:58
    text: to look at is which AI tools to use.
  - start: 00:01:01
    text: First of all, cloth code or open code
  - start: 00:01:02
    text: for coding, right? You need an
  - start: 00:01:03
    text: autonomous AI agent and these two are
  - start: 00:01:05
    text: the best right now. Then you need an
  - start: 00:01:06
    text: IDE. So we're going to use cursor or VS
  - start: 00:01:08
    text: code. Then CEX. This is also another
  - start: 00:01:10
    text: coding agent. But Codex is exceptionally
  - start: 00:01:11
    text: good for debugging. It's way less lazy
  - start: 00:01:13
    text: than cloud code. So definitely use
  - start: 00:01:14
    text: Codex. Agent Zero for all kinds of
  - start: 00:01:16
    text: manual tasks. You need to turn the logo
  - start: 00:01:18
    text: into a favicon. You need to convert
  - start: 00:01:19
    text: files. You need to do some data
  - start: 00:01:20
    text: analysis. Agent Zero will do it
  - start: 00:01:21
    text: instantly. Perplexity for web search and
  - start: 00:01:23
    text: deep research. Fireflies for meeting
  - start: 00:01:25
    text: transcription when you're doing customer
  - start: 00:01:26
    text: calls, stuff like that. And then you
  - start: 00:01:28
    text: want something in your CI/CD for
  - start: 00:01:29
    text: preventing bugs. So either Code Rabbit
  - start: 00:01:31
    text: or Bugbot, these are the AI tools you
  - start: 00:01:33
    text: need. You don't need more. A lot of you
  - start: 00:01:34
    text: are over complicating your AI stack.
  - start: 00:01:36
    text: Keep it simple and just master a few AI
  - start: 00:01:37
    text: tools. Speaking of stacks, let's look at
  - start: 00:01:39
    text: the tech stack. Right? So this is
  - start: 00:01:40
    text: probably one of the most important
  - start: 00:01:41
    text: points. Sometimes this doesn't apply for
  - start: 00:01:43
    text: 100% of AI SAS, but for most of them,
  - start: 00:01:45
    text: you're going to go with this, right? So
  - start: 00:01:46
    text: let's look at front end. We're going
  - start: 00:01:47
    text: with Nex.js. Very popular framework,
  - start: 00:01:49
    text: fast improving, and has basically
  - start: 00:01:51
    text: everything you need. Tailwind CSS for
  - start: 00:01:52
    text: the styling and chats and UI for
  - start: 00:01:54
    text: pre-built UI components. So you can
  - start: 00:01:55
    text: build even faster for inference where
  - start: 00:01:57
    text: you run inference of AI models. Open
  - start: 00:01:59
    text: router you can have everything there.
  - start: 00:02:00
    text: Literally all of the models that you can
  - start: 00:02:02
    text: imagine are available on open router. So
  - start: 00:02:04
    text: you just integrate this and you can
  - start: 00:02:05
    text: easily switch between models in your AI
  - start: 00:02:06
    text: SAS or if you want more privacy focused
  - start: 00:02:08
    text: approach. Venice AI is great. They're
  - start: 00:02:10
    text: focused on unbiased AI and private AI.
  - start: 00:02:12
    text: They're not collecting your data stuff
  - start: 00:02:13
    text: like that. So these two are the only two
  - start: 00:02:15
    text: inference providers you really need in
  - start: 00:02:16
    text: terms of back end.js Python with fast
  - start: 00:02:18
    text: API like these are the two mainstream
  - start: 00:02:20
    text: text tags. Again, don't choose a text
  - start: 00:02:22
    text: stack that's like esoteric, that's, you
  - start: 00:02:23
    text: know, random, new. No, choose something
  - start: 00:02:25
    text: that's super popular. As you can notice,
  - start: 00:02:27
    text: Nex.js, Python, like these are all
  - start: 00:02:29
    text: mainstream, right? The reason for that
  - start: 00:02:30
    text: is there's a lot of training data in the
  - start: 00:02:31
    text: AI models. So, the models can help you a
  - start: 00:02:33
    text: lot. So, keep it simple. Don't
  - start: 00:02:34
    text: overengineer your tech stack. Same with
  - start: 00:02:36
    text: the database. Just stick to SQL,
  - start: 00:02:37
    text: Postgress, that's all you need. If you
  - start: 00:02:38
    text: want something faster, Reddis cache is
  - start: 00:02:40
    text: great. If you're not a senior developer
