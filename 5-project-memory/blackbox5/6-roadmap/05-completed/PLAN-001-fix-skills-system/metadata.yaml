problem:
  summary: "Skills system has 3 different implementations causing broken agent skill loading"
  impact: "Agents cannot attach skills, crippling agent capabilities"
  duplicates: 0
  total_skills: 11
  unique_skills: 11

solution:
  approach: "Single canonical skills/ directory already exists"
  outcome: "NO ACTION REQUIRED - Skills system verified as healthy"
  findings:
    - "Single canonical system at 2-engine/.autonomous/skills/"
    - "11 BMAD skills operational"
    - "SkillRouter correctly configured"
    - "No duplicate skills found"
    - "Original PLAN-001 referenced non-existent directories (skills-cap/, .skills-new/)"

files_to_change:
  - "NONE - System already correct"

risks:
  - risk: "Wrong system chosen"

  - risk: "Test failures"

  - risk: "Agent incompatibility"
    probability: "resolved"
    impact: "none"
    mitigation: "N/A - agents use existing system"

notes: |
  Original PLAN-001 was based on outdated information about 3 skills systems.
  Audit revealed only ONE canonical system exists at 2-engine/.autonomous/skills/.
  The directories mentioned in original plan (skills-cap/, .skills-new/) do not exist.
  System is healthy and operational - no consolidation needed.
