# CLAUDE.md Guidance Effectiveness Improvement Plan

## Overview

CLAUDE.md exists but hasn't been systematically improved. This plan analyzes guidance effectiveness, refines decision frameworks, optimizes operational procedures, and validates improvements.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] 5+ instances of hesitation/confusion identified and fixed
- [ ] Decision framework has specific examples for each case
- [ ] Subagent deployment rules are clear with thresholds
- [ ] Context management thresholds tuned based on data
- [ ] Skill discovery time reduced by 50%
- [ ] Quality gates have per-task-type checklists

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Analyze Guidance Effectiveness (Week 1)

**Objective:** Review past runs to identify friction points

**Sub-goal:** SG-001-1 (Analyze guidance effectiveness)

**Tasks:**
1. Review last 20 runs for hesitation patterns
2. Document instances where agent was uncertain
3. Measure decision time for different task types
4. Identify sections of CLAUDE.md causing delays
5. Document operational friction points

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- 5+ hesitation instances documented
- Decision time measured per task type
- Problematic CLAUDE.md sections identified
- Friction points catalogued

### Phase 2: Refine Decision Framework (Week 2)

**Objective:** Make decision framework specific with examples

**Sub-goal:** SG-001-2 (Refine decision framework)

**Tasks:**
1. Add specific examples for "Just Do It" cases
2. Add specific examples for "Create Formal Task" cases
3. Add specific examples for "Ask User" cases
4. Clarify subagent deployment rules with file count thresholds
5. Tune context management thresholds (70%/85%/95%) based on data

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Each decision type has 3+ concrete examples
- Subagent rules include specific thresholds
- Context thresholds tuned with rationale
- Decision time reduced by 30%

### Phase 3: Optimize Operational Procedures (Week 2)

**Objective:** Streamline skill discovery and quality gates

**Sub-goal:** SG-001-3 (Optimize operational procedures)

**Tasks:**
1. Implement skill caching (frequently used skills)
2. Create quality gate checklists for each task type
3. Optimize run initialization (template copying)
4. Document optimized procedures

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Skill selection time reduced by 50%
- Quality gate checklists exist for: bug fix, feature, refactor, research
- Run initialization time reduced by 30%
- Fewer missed quality checks

### Phase 4: Validate Improvements (Week 3)

**Objective:** Test refined guidance on real tasks

**Sub-goal:** SG-001-4 (Validate improvements)

**Tasks:**
1. Select 5 representative tasks
2. Measure task initiation time (before vs after)
3. Track context overflow exits
4. Track subagent usage appropriateness
5. Document improvements

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Faster task initiation (measured improvement)
- Fewer context overflow exits
- More appropriate subagent usage
- Documented improvement metrics

## Dependencies

- CLAUDE.md files (global and project)
- Run history in `.autonomous/runs/`
- Task history for measurement

| Phase | Duration | Focus |
|-------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Week 1 | Analyze effectiveness |
| 2 | Week 2 | Refine framework |
| 3 | Week 2 | Optimize procedures |
