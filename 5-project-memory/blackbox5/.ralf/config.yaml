# Task Selection Configuration
# Controls how tasks are selected from the queue
task_selection:
  # Enable randomization among same-priority tasks
  # When enabled, tasks within the same priority group are selected randomly
  # When disabled, always picks the first task (highest priority_score)
  randomization_enabled: true

  # Randomization factor: 0.0 to 1.0
  # 0.0 = Deterministic (always pick highest priority_score)
  # 0.5 = Balanced (equal weight to priority and randomness)
  # 1.0 = Fully random (ignore priority_score, pure random selection)
  randomization_factor: 0.3

  # Fairness window: Number of recent selections to track per task
  # Tasks selected within this window get lower probability
  # Prevents the same task from being selected repeatedly
  fairness_window: 5

  # Fairness boost factor: How much to boost tasks not recently selected
  # Higher values = stronger preference for unselected tasks
  fairness_boost_factor: 1.5
