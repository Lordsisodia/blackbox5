## Purpose

This section bridges theory and practice. It documents:
- How systems are built
- Code organization and patterns
- Integration points
- Configuration details

## Contributing

When documenting implementation:
1. Include code examples where helpful
2. Link to relevant theory in `01-theory/`
3. Reference related guides in `03-guides/`
4. Keep architecture diagrams up to date
