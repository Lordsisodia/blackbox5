# 01 - Theory

This section contains theoretical foundations, research, and architectural concepts for the Blackbox5 system.

## Subsections

### 01-foundations/
Core theoretical concepts and foundational principles.

### 02-agent-architecture/
Agent design patterns, cognitive architectures, and behavioral models.

### 03-memory-systems/
Memory system theory, retention strategies, and recall mechanisms.

### 04-communication/
Inter-agent communication protocols and message passing theory.

### 05-autonomous-systems/
Research on autonomous systems, self-governing agents, and auto-claude implementations.

## Purpose

The theory section provides the intellectual foundation for implementation decisions. Before building, we understand:
- Why certain patterns are chosen
- What problems we're solving
- How agents should behave
- What trade-offs exist

## Contributing

When adding new theoretical content:
1. Place research in the appropriate subsection
2. Link to related implementation docs in `02-implementation/`
3. Include references and sources where applicable
