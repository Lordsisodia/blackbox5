IMPORTANT: this context may or may not be relevant to your tasks. You should not respond to this context unless it is highly relevant to your task.

## Superintelligence Hand-Off Protocol (Auto-Activation)

You have access to the **Superintelligence Protocol** at `/Users/shaansisodia/.blackbox5/6-roadmap/01-research/superintelligence-protocol/`.

### When to Auto-Activate

**Activate the protocol WITHOUT asking when:**
- User asks architecture/design questions ("Should we...", "How should we...", "What's the best way to...")
- Task involves multiple files or systems
- High uncertainty or novel problem
- User seems to be making a significant decision
- Keywords: architecture, design, refactor, optimize, strategy, complex, integrate

**Don't activate for:**
- Simple file edits
- Clear bug fixes
- Information lookups
- Routine tasks

### How to Activate

```
When you detect a complex problem:

1. Say: "I'll activate the superintelligence protocol for this."

2. Execute the 7-step process:
   - Context Gathering (scan relevant projects/folders)
   - First Principles (break down the problem)
   - Information Gap (identify unknowns)
   - Active Research (search, verify, test)
   - Multi-Perspective (deploy expert agents)
   - Meta-Cognitive Check (verify reasoning)
   - Synthesis (integrate into recommendation)

3. Return: Clear recommendation with confidence score, assumptions, and implementation path
```

### Expert Agents Available

Deploy these sub-agents as needed:
- **Architect** - System design, patterns, scalability
- **Researcher** - Information gathering, best practices
- **Critic** - Risk analysis, edge cases, failure modes
- **Synthesizer** - Integration of multiple perspectives

### Context Management

- Use sub-agents to gather context (don't waste your context window)
- Scan projects first, then folders
- Cache context for reuse
- Return only synthesized, high-value insights

### Output Format

Always return:
```
**Recommendation:** [Clear answer]
**Confidence:** [0-100%]
**Key Assumptions:** [What we're betting on]
**Risks:** [What could go wrong]
**Implementation Path:** [Next steps]
```

## Examples of Auto-Activation

**User:** "Should we refactor the auth system?"
→ **You:** "I'll activate the superintelligence protocol for this." [Proceed with 7-step analysis]

**User:** "What's the best architecture for real-time collaboration?"
→ **You:** "I'll activate the superintelligence protocol for this." [Proceed with analysis]

**User:** "Fix this typo"
→ **You:** [Fix directly, no protocol needed]

## BlackBox5 Workflow Integration

### Workspace & Task Management

**For EVERY new task, you MUST:**

1. **Create/Use Workspace**
   - Work in `~/.blackbox5/5-project-memory/[project]/.autonomous/`
   - Create run folder: `runs/run-YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/`
   - Initialize with: THOUGHTS.md, DECISIONS.md, ASSUMPTIONS.md, LEARNINGS.md, RESULTS.md

2. **Select ONE Task**
   - Check `tasks/active/` for pending tasks
   - Read task file completely before starting
   - ONE task per session - never batch multiple tasks

3. **Track Progress**
   - Update `fix_plan.md` after each task completion
   - Update `prd.json` with task status
   - Document in run folder files

4. **Commit & Update BlackBox5**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b claude/[task-slug]
   git add [files]
   git commit -m "claude: [component] [description]

   - Detailed changes
   - Task: [TASK-ID]
   - Validation: [results]

   Co-authored-by: Claude <claude@blackbox5.local>"
   git push origin claude/[task-slug]
   ```

5. **Exit Properly**
   - Return `PROMISE_COMPLETE` when done
   - Status: COMPLETE | PARTIAL | BLOCKED
   - Document next steps

### Sub-Agent Rules

**ALWAYS spawn sub-agents for:**
- Codebase exploration (finding files, patterns)
- Context gathering (reading multiple files)
- Research (investigating unknown areas)
- Validation (reviewing your work)

**NEVER spawn sub-agents for:**
- Simple file reads (use Read tool directly)
- Implementation work (do it yourself)
- Known locations

### Context Management

- **70% context usage:** Summarize THOUGHTS.md
- **85% context usage:** Complete current task, exit with PARTIAL
- **95% context usage:** Force checkpoint, exit immediately

### BlackBox5 Directory Structure

```

```

### Integration with Superintelligence Protocol

When working on BlackBox5:
- Reference the Superintelligence Protocol documentation
- Use the Project Scanner for context gathering
- Follow the Iterative Improvement Framework
- Document learnings in the protocol research directory
- Update BlackBox5 state after every significant change

---

## Task File Format

Tasks in `tasks/active/` follow this structure:

```markdown
# TASK-[ID]: [Title]

**Status:** pending | in_progress | completed
**Priority:** CRITICAL | HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW
**Created:** YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ

## Objective
Clear one-sentence goal.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

## Context
Background information needed to complete the task.

## Approach
1. Step 1
2. Step 2

## Rollback Strategy
How to undo if things go wrong.
```

---

## Decision Framework

### When to Just Do It
- Clear bug fix (< 30 min)
- Simple edit (< 10 min)
- Documentation typo
- Single file change

### When to Create Formal Task
- > 30 minutes of work
- Touches multiple files
- Requires research
- Has dependencies

### When to Hand Off to RALF
- Task queue is empty (let RALF generate)
- Requires continuous iteration
- Long-running improvement
- Fits RALF's autonomous loop pattern

### When to Ask User
- Requirements unclear
- Scope creep detected
- External dependency blocked
- High-risk change (affects critical path)
- Uncertain about approach

---

## Stop Conditions

**PAUSE and ask user when:**

1. **Unclear Requirements** - Task objective is ambiguous
2. **Scope Creep** - Task growing beyond original intent
3. **Blocked** - Waiting on external input/dependency
4. **High Risk** - Change could break critical systems
5. **Context Overflow** - At 85% token usage with work remaining
6. **Contradiction** - Finding conflicts with existing code/docs
7. **No Clear Path** - Multiple approaches, uncertain which is best

**EXIT with status when:**

- COMPLETE: All success criteria met
- PARTIAL: Progress made, more work needed
- BLOCKED: Cannot proceed without human input

---

## Installation Instructions

1. Copy this file to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
2. Replace `[BLACKBOX5_PATH]` with your actual BlackBox5 path
3. Replace `[YOUR_DEVICE]` with your device name
4. Update `[DATE]` with current date
5. Start Claude Code - this context will load automatically

## Integration with Other Systems

### RALF Handoff
- RALF handles autonomous loops when task queue is empty
- You handle user-directed tasks
- Hand off when: queue empty, continuous iteration needed, long-running tasks

### Superintelligence Protocol
- Auto-activates for complex tasks
- Provides 7-dimensional reasoning
- Use for: architecture, design, complex decisions

### BlackBox5 Memory
- All work tracked in `5-project-memory/`
- Tasks, runs, decisions, insights stored there
- Update after every session
