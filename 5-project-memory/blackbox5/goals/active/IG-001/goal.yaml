notes: |
  Merged IG-002 on 2026-02-10: LEGACY.md operational procedures are now part
  of this goal. The distinction between "guidance" and "operations" was
  artificial - both are about helping agents make better decisions faster.

  Current issues identified:
  - Decision framework could be more specific
  - Context management thresholds may need tuning
  - Sub-agent deployment rules could be clearer
  - Skill discovery may be too slow
  - Quality gates could be more specific
  - Run initialization takes time

  Target files:
  - ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md (decision guidance)
  - ~/blackbox5/5-project-memory/blackbox5/.claude/CLAUDE.md (project guidance)

  Success means faster, more confident decision-making and smoother execution.
