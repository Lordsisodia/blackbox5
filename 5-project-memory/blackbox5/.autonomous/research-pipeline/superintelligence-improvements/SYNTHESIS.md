# Superintelligence Protocol v2: Improvement Synthesis

**Generated by:** Multi-Agent Superintelligence Analysis
**Date:** 2026-02-08
**Agents Deployed:** Architect, Researcher, Critic, Implementer

---

## Executive Summary

**Recommendation:** Implement Superintelligence Protocol v2 with adaptive step selection, outcome tracking, cost awareness, and consensus mechanisms.

**Confidence:** 80%
**Key Assumptions:**
- Problems vary in complexity (not all need 7 steps)
- Outcome data can improve future activations
- Cost/latency matter for production use
- Expert disagreement needs resolution

## Critical Findings from Sub-Agents

### Critic Agent: Top Risks

| Rank | Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|------|----------|------------|
| 1 | **Always-On Execution Trap** - Always runs all 7 steps | CRITICAL | Adaptive step selection |
| 2 | **Static Skill Syndrome** - No learning/feedback | HIGH | Outcome tracking + telemetry |
| 3 | **Sub-Agent Disagreement Cascade** - No resolution | HIGH | Consensus mechanism |
| 4 | **Cost-Blindness** - No budget awareness | MODERATE | Cost controller |
| 5 | **Confirmation Bias Loop** - Self-reinforcing errors | MODERATE | Random expert injection |

### Architect Agent: Core Improvements

1. **Runtime State Machine** - Track progress, enable pause/resume
2. **Complexity-Based Step Selection** - Dynamic 3/5/7 step paths
3. **Budget Controller** - Cost/time/token limits with early termination

### Researcher Agent: Research-Backed Recommendations

From Meta/Google/UC Berkeley 2025 research:

1. **Adaptive Step Selection** - Match compute to problem complexity
2. **Feedback Loops** - Meta-review checkpoint after multi-perspective
3. **Process Reward Models (PRMs)** - Step-level validation
4. **Compute Budgeting** - Dynamic resource allocation
5. **Consensus Mechanisms** - PBFT-inspired expert conflict resolution

### Implementer Agent: Quick Wins

1. **Fast-Path Decision Tree** - Skip protocol for simple cases
2. **Confidence-Based Skipping** - Skip dimensions when confident
3. **Sub-Agent Shortcuts** - Pre-defined expert combos
4. **Context Budget Optimizer** - Smart truncation by relevance
5. **Output Template Shortcuts** - Pre-formatted responses

## Unified Improvement Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate (This Week)

**Goal:** Address critical risks with minimal changes

| Improvement | Source | Effort | Impact |
|-------------|--------|--------|--------|
| Fast-path decision tree | Implementer | 15 min | 40% bypass rate |
| Add outcome tracking | Critic | 30 min | Enables learning |
| Confidence-based skipping | Architect | 20 min | 30% token savings |
| Cost display | Critic | 15 min | User awareness |

**Implementation:**
```yaml
# Add to SKILL.md
adaptive_mode:
  enabled: true

  fast_paths:
    - pattern: "simple|quick|minor|typo|fix"
      action: "bypass_protocol"
    - pattern: "single file"
      action: "bypass_protocol"

  complexity_levels:
    simple: [context_gathering, first_principles, synthesis]
    moderate: [context_gathering, first_principles, active_research, multi_perspective, synthesis]
    complex: [all_7_steps]

  early_exit:
    confidence_threshold: 0.85
    max_iterations: 5
```

### Phase 2: Short-Term (Next 2 Weeks)

**Goal:** Add state management and cost controls

| Improvement | Source | Effort | Impact |
|-------------|--------|--------|--------|
| Runtime state machine | Architect | 2 days | Reliability |
| Budget controller | Architect | 1 day | Cost control |
| Sub-agent shortcuts | Implementer | 4 hours | Efficiency |
| Context optimizer | Implementer | 4 hours | Token savings |

**Implementation:**
```python
class SuperintelligenceProtocol:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = StateMachine()
        self.budget = BudgetController()
        self.complexity = ComplexityClassifier()

    def activate(self, task):
        # Classify complexity
        level = self.complexity.classify(task)

        # Select steps
        steps = self.select_steps(level)

        # Execute with budget monitoring
        for step in steps:
            if not self.budget.can_execute(step):
                return self.early_synthesis()
            result = step.execute()
            self.state.checkpoint(step, result)
```

### Phase 3: Medium-Term (Next Month)

**Goal:** Add research-backed advanced features

| Improvement | Source | Effort | Impact |
|-------------|--------|--------|--------|
| Feedback loops | Researcher | 3 days | Quality |
| Process Reward Models | Researcher | 4 days | Accuracy |
| Consensus mechanisms | Researcher | 5 days | Reliability |
| Learning from outcomes | Critic | 3 days | Improvement |

**Implementation:**
```python
# Feedback loop
class MetaReview:
    def check(self, perspectives):
        if self.has_conflicts(perspectives):
            return Action.GATHER_MORE_EVIDENCE
        if self.confidence_insufficient(perspectives):
            return Action.ADD_EXPERT
        return Action.PROCEED_TO_SYNTHESIS

# Consensus mechanism
class ExpertConsensus:
    def resolve(self, opinions):
        clusters = self.cluster_by_similarity(opinions)
        if clusters.has_supermajority():
            return clusters.supermajority_position()
        return self.escalate_to_human()
```

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | Measurement |

## Rollback Plan

If improvements cause issues:

1. **Disable adaptive mode:**
   ```yaml
   adaptive_mode:
     enabled: false  # Revert to static 7-step
   ```

2. **Fallback to v1 skill:**
   ```bash
   cp superintelligence-protocol/SKILL.md.v1 superintelligence-protocol/SKILL.md
   ```

3. **Emergency bypass:**
   ```bash
   export BB5_DISABLE_SI_ADAPTIVE=1
   ```

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Implement Phase 1 quick wins (today)
2. **This week:** Deploy and test adaptive mode
3. **Next week:** Begin Phase 2 state machine
4. **This month:** Complete Phase 3 advanced features
5. **Ongoing:** Track metrics, iterate based on data
