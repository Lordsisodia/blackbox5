I don't want it to create runs every 20 seconds. I want the multbot to manage what's going on, and I want the multbot to be able to make runs happen. The RALF loop isn't supposed to create runs every 20 seconds. It's supposed to run, run a bunch of agent teams, log everything that happened, and then stop. And then literally as soon as it stops, restart again on a fresh thingy which checks everything and sees what the next steps is and sees the previous context.

You already have my Hellzinger SSH. Use super intelligence to do this, make sure it's running properly on my VPS and make sure Moltbot is managing it.Well, not a Moltbot like her, but a continuous cloud code agent and Moltbots just checking and making sure shit works.
