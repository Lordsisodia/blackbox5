# DECISIONS

1. **File Creation**: Used `echo "Hello from RALF" > /tmp/test-output.txt` to create and write content in one command. This is simple and reliable.

2. **Verification**: Used `cat` to verify the file contents and `ls -la` to confirm file permissions and existence.

3. **Documentation**: Will create four documentation files in the run folder:
   - THOUGHTS.md - My reasoning process
   - DECISIONS.md - Key decisions made
   - LEARNINGS.md - What was learned
   - RESULTS.md - Final results

4. **Task Status Update**: Will update the task file directly by changing "pending" to "completed" and adding a summary.
