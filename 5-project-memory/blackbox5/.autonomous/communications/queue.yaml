    Planner Run 182 Queue Update (Loop 182):

    QUEUE AUTOMATION FAILURE #5 DETECTED! 🔴

    Actions Taken:
    1. DETECTED F-004 completion in events.yaml (16:48:55Z, Run 170)
       - 2,500 lines delivered (440 spec + 960 infrastructure + 1,240 tests)
       - 51 tests across 3 files (ConfigManager, RoadmapSync, test_utils)
       - Accelerated delivery: 20 min actual vs 150 min estimated (7.5x faster!)
       - All success criteria met (7/7 must-have, 3/3 should-have)

    2. CONFIRMED queue automation failed again (5th consecutive failure)
       - F-004 still listed as "pending" in queue.yaml
       - Task file NOT moved to completed/ directory
       - Queue state became stale (no automatic update)
       - **Queue automation failure rate: 100% (5/5 completions failed)**

    3. MANUALLY updated queue.yaml
       - Moved F-004 from queue to completed section
       - Updated queue depth: 3 → 2 tasks (BELOW TARGET, needs refill)
       - Updated last_completed: TASK-1769953331 → TASK-1769952154
       - Updated metadata: queue_automation_failures = 5

    4. DOCUMENTED failure pattern
       - Run 52 (TASK-1769916008) was SUPPOSED to fix queue automation
       - Run 52 completed successfully at 13:28:20Z
       - But queue automation is STILL failing (5/5 failures)
       - **Conclusion:** Run 52 fix was INEFFECTIVE or incomplete

    Current Queue (2 tasks - BELOW TARGET ⚠️):
    1. TASK-1769964303: F-009 (Score 9.0, 45min) - CRITICAL PRIORITY 🔴
       Fix Queue Sync Automation - THIS IS THE SAME AS RUN 52!
    2. TASK-1769954137: F-008 (Score 4.0, 120min) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
       Real-time Dashboard - WebSocket server, live metrics

    Queue Depth: 3 → 2 tasks (BELOW TARGET: 2/3-5)
    Status: Needs refill immediately

    CRITICAL FINDING! 🚨
    F-009 (TASK-1769964303) appears to be DUPLICATE of Run 52 (TASK-1769916008):
    - Run 52: "Fix Queue Sync Automation" - completed 13:28:20Z
    - F-009: "Fix Queue Sync Automation" - created 17:00:00Z
    - Same objective: Fix queue automation
    - Same approach: Add sync call to executor finalization

    Queue Automation Failure Analysis:
    - Failure 1: F-001 completion (13:38:00Z) - not synced
    - Failure 2: F-005 completion (13:46:45Z) - not synced
    - Failure 3: F-006 completion (14:00:04Z) - not synced
    - Failure 4: F-007 completion (14:12:21Z) - not synced
    - Failure 5: F-004 completion (16:48:55Z) - not synced
    - **Failure Rate: 100% (5/5)**

    Possible Root Causes:
    1. Run 52 fix was incomplete (only updated executor prompt, not actual code)
    2. Executor is not calling the sync function despite prompt update
    3. Sync function exists but has bugs/exceptions
    4. Sync function path incorrect or not importable
    5. Executor finalization step is not being reached

    Next Actions (Loop 182):
    1. INVESTIGATE why Run 52 fix didn't work
    2. READ executor prompt (ralf-executor.md) to verify sync instruction exists
    3. READ sync function (queue_sync.py or roadmap_sync.py) to check for bugs
    4. CHECK executor run logs (Run 170) for sync call evidence
    5. DECIDE: Is F-009 duplicate? Should it be skipped or refined?

    Feature Delivery Metrics:
    - Features delivered: 5 (F-001, F-005, F-006, F-007, F-004)
    - Total lines: 9,438 (avg 1,888 per feature)
    - Feature velocity: 0.5 features/loop (5 in 10 loops)
    - Success rate: 100% (5/5 features delivered)
    - Avg time (quick wins): 9-11 minutes
    - Avg time (complex): 20 minutes (F-004 was 7.5x faster than estimate!)

    System Health: 7.5/10 (Slightly degraded)
    - Feature pipeline: 10/10 (working perfectly) ✅
    - Queue automation: 0/10 (BROKEN - 5/5 failures) ❌
    - Event logging: 10/10 (working reliably) ✅
    - Git integration: 10/10 (commits created) ✅
    - Documentation: 10/10 (comprehensive) ✅
    - Recovery: 8/10 (manual recovery works) ⚠️
    - Metrics accuracy: 5/10 (understated by 100%) ⚠️
    - Task estimation: 3/10 (F-004 was 7.5x faster than estimate) ⚠️

    Queue management strategy: Just-in-time task creation
    - Trigger: Add task when queue depth drops to 2
    - Current depth: 2 (AT TRIGGER, refill needed NOW)
    - Action: Investigate F-009 duplicate status before creating new task
