# Memory Insights Index

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-09

This directory contains indexed insights and learnings extracted from BB5 task runs.

## Files

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `learning-index.yaml` | Structured learnings from all runs | Auto-generated |
| `index.md` | This documentation file | Manual |

## Learning Categories

### By Type
- **pattern** - Recurring patterns or best practices
- **decision** - Architectural or technical decisions
- **challenge** - Problems encountered and their resolutions
- **optimization** - Performance improvements
- **bugfix** - Bug fixes and error resolutions
- **insight** - General insights and observations

### By Domain
- **technical** - Code, implementation, technical details
- **process** - Workflow, methodology, procedures
- **architectural** - System design, patterns, structure
- **operational** - Deployment, monitoring, maintenance

---

## Memory Networks

### World (Facts)
Objective facts about technologies, systems, and the codebase.

**Examples:**
- PostgreSQL with pgvector is used for vector similarity search
- The CLI is built using Click framework
- Configuration is stored in YAML files

### Experience (Actions)
First-person actions and their outcomes.

**Examples:**
- Implemented the RETAIN operation for memory storage
- Fixed the path resolution bug in the extractor
- Refactored the vector store to use async operations

### Opinion (Beliefs)
Subjective beliefs with confidence levels.

**Examples:**
- LLM-based extraction is more accurate than rule-based (confidence: 0.9)
- PostgreSQL is sufficient for current scale (confidence: 0.8)
- The 4-network architecture provides clear separation (confidence: 0.95)

### Observation (Insights)
Synthesized insights and patterns discovered across multiple tasks.

**Examples:**
- Most memory queries are for technical facts (World network)
- Learning extraction works best with structured markdown files
- Vector similarity search provides better results than keyword matching

## Usage

### Query Learnings
```bash
# Search for specific patterns
grep -r "pattern" learning-index.yaml

# Find high-severity learnings
grep -A 5 "severity: critical" learning-index.yaml
```

### Add Learning
Learnings are automatically extracted from task runs. To manually add:

1. Run the extraction tool:
   ```bash
   python ../extraction/learning_extractor.py --run-dir /path/to/run
   ```

2. Or edit `learning-index.yaml` directly (not recommended)

---

## Maintenance

### Backfill Historical Runs
```bash
python ../extraction/backfill_learnings.py
```

### Health Check
```bash
python ../extraction/check_learning_index.py
```

### Rebuild from Scratch
```bash
python ../extraction/backfill_learnings.py --rebuild
```

---

## Statistics

*Statistics are generated by the health check tool*

Run `python ../extraction/check_learning_index.py` for current stats.
