  title: Implement Lines-Per-Minute Estimation Formula
  category: process
  status: downgraded
  rationale: '**Implement lines-per-minute estimation formula for all future tasks.**


    **Formula:**

    ```

    Estimated Minutes = Expected Lines / 270


    Where:

    - Expected Lines = Sum of (spec_lines + code_lines + docs_lines)

    - 270 = Mean throughput from 7 executor runs (runs 56-62)

    ```


    **Evidence:**

    1. **Loop 24 Analys'
