  # TurboClaude
  
  **UNOFFICIAL SDK** - This is an unofficial, community-maintained Rust SDK for Anthropic's Claude API. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by Anthropic.
  
  **Maintained by:** [epistates](https://github.com/epistates)
  
  Rust SDK for Anthropic's Claude API that covers the same features as the official Python SDK.
  
  ## Quick Start
  
  ```bash
  # Add to your Cargo.toml
  [dependencies]
  turboclaude = "0.2"
  
  # Set your API key
  export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
  
  # Run an example
  cargo run --example basic
  ```
  
  See `examples/` directory for usage examples.
  
  ## Which Crate Do I Need?
  
  Coming from Python? Here's the mapping to find the right TurboClaude crate:
  
  | Use Case | Python Package | Rust Crate | Purpose |
  |----------|---|---|---|
  | **Claude API Client** | `anthropic` | [`turboclaude`](./crates/turboclaude/README.md) | REST API client for Claude messages, batches, models |
  | **Agent Framework** | `anthropic.agent` | [`turboclaudeagent`](./crates/turboclaudeagent/README.md) | Build interactive agents with hooks, permissions, routing |
  | **Skills & Tools** | `anthropic.tools` | [`turboclaude-skills`](./crates/turboclaude-skills/README.md) | Dynamic skill registration and execution system |
  | **Protocol Types** | (type definitions) | [`turboclaude-protocol`](./crates/turboclaude-protocol/README.md) | Shared message types, content blocks, tools |
  | **Transport Layer** | (internal) | [`turboclaude-transport`](./crates/turboclaude-transport/README.md) | HTTP and subprocess transport abstractions |
  | **Core Abstractions** | (internal) | [`turboclaude-core`](./crates/turboclaude-core/README.md) | Base traits, builders, error handling |
  | **MCP Integration** | (via external) | [`turboclaude-mcp`](./crates/turboclaude-mcp/README.md) | Model Context Protocol adapter and factory |
  
  ### Examples by Use Case
  
  **Just need to send messages?**
  ```toml
  [dependencies]
  turboclaude = "0.2"
  ```
  
  **Building an AI agent with custom behavior?**
  ```toml
  [dependencies]
  turboclaudeagent = "0.2"
  turboclaude-skills = "0.2"
  ```
  
  **Integrating with Model Context Protocol servers?**
  ```toml
  [dependencies]
  turboclaude = { version = "0.2", features = ["mcp"] }
  turboclaude-mcp = "0.2"
  ```
  
  **Everything (AWS Bedrock, Vertex AI, all features)?**
  ```toml
  [dependencies]
  turboclaude = { version = "0.2", features = ["bedrock", "vertex", "schema", "mcp", "trace"] }
  turboclaudeagent = "0.2"
  turboclaude-skills = "0.2"
  ```
  
  ## Architecture Goals
  
  The SDK follows these design principles:
  
  1. **Type Safety**: Use Rust's type system for compile-time guarantees
  2. **Performance**: Zero-cost abstractions and efficient streaming
  3. **Compatibility**: Support the same features as the official Python SDK
  4. **Extensibility**: Support integration with MCP and other protocols
  
  ## Architecture
  
  ### Core Design Decisions
  
  #### 1. **Async-First with Optional Blocking**
  - **Decision**: Single async implementation with optional blocking wrapper
  - **Rationale**: Rust's async is zero-cost; blocking can be added as a thin wrapper
  - **Trade-off**: Slightly more complex for sync-only users, but better performance and maintainability
  
  ```rust
  // Async (default)
  let client = Client::new("sk-...");
  let msg = client.messages().create(request).await?;
  
  // Blocking (optional feature)
  #[cfg(feature = "blocking")]
  let client = turboclaude::blocking::Client::new("sk-...");
  let msg = client.messages().create(request)?;
  ```
  
  #### 2. **Lazy Resource Initialization (like Python's @cached_property)**
  - **Decision**: Use `OnceCell` for lazy resource initialization
  - **Rationale**: Avoids circular dependencies, reduces initial overhead
