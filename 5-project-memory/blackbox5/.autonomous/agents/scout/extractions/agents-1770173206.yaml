  # Claude Code Plugins: Orchestration and Automation
  
  > **⚡ Updated for Opus 4.5, Sonnet 4.5 & Haiku 4.5** — Three-tier model strategy for optimal performance
  
  [![Run in Smithery](https://smithery.ai/badge/skills/wshobson)](https://smithery.ai/skills?ns=wshobson&utm_source=github&utm_medium=badge)
  
  > **🎯 Agent Skills Enabled** — 129 specialized skills extend Claude's capabilities across plugins with progressive disclosure
  
  A comprehensive production-ready system combining **108 specialized AI agents**, **15 multi-agent workflow orchestrators**, **129 agent skills**, and **72 development tools** organized into **72 focused, single-purpose plugins** for [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview).
  
  ## Overview
  
  This unified repository provides everything needed for intelligent automation and multi-agent orchestration across modern software development:
  
  - **72 Focused Plugins** - Granular, single-purpose plugins optimized for minimal token usage and composability
  - **108 Specialized Agents** - Domain experts with deep knowledge across architecture, languages, infrastructure, quality, data/AI, documentation, business operations, and SEO
  - **129 Agent Skills** - Modular knowledge packages with progressive disclosure for specialized expertise
  - **15 Workflow Orchestrators** - Multi-agent coordination systems for complex operations like full-stack development, security hardening, ML pipelines, and incident response
  - **72 Development Tools** - Optimized utilities including project scaffolding, security scanning, test automation, and infrastructure setup
  
  ### Key Features
  
  - **Granular Plugin Architecture**: 72 focused plugins optimized for minimal token usage
  - **Comprehensive Tooling**: 72 development tools including test generation, scaffolding, and security scanning
  - **100% Agent Coverage**: All plugins include specialized agents
  - **Agent Skills**: 129 specialized skills following for progressive disclosure and token efficiency
  - **Clear Organization**: 23 categories with 1-6 plugins each for easy discovery
  - **Efficient Design**: Average 3.4 components per plugin (follows Anthropic's 2-8 pattern)
  
  ### How It Works
  
  Each plugin is completely isolated with its own agents, commands, and skills:
  
  - **Install only what you need** - Each plugin loads only its specific agents, commands, and skills
  - **Minimal token usage** - No unnecessary resources loaded into context
  - **Mix and match** - Compose multiple plugins for complex workflows
  - **Clear boundaries** - Each plugin has a single, focused purpose
  - **Progressive disclosure** - Skills load knowledge only when activated
  
  **Example**: Installing `python-development` loads 3 Python agents, 1 scaffolding tool, and makes 16 skills available (~1000 tokens), not the entire marketplace.
  
  ## Quick Start
  
  ### Step 1: Add the Marketplace
  
  Add this marketplace to Claude Code:
  
  ```bash
  /plugin marketplace add wshobson/agents
  ```
  
  This makes all 72 plugins available for installation, but **does not load any agents or tools** into your context.
  
  ### Step 2: Install Plugins
  
  Browse available plugins:
  
  ```bash
  /plugin
  ```
  
  Install the plugins you need:
  
  ```bash
  # Essential development plugins
  /plugin install python-development          # Python with 16 specialized skills
  /plugin install javascript-typescript       # JS/TS with 4 specialized skills
  /plugin install backend-development         # Backend APIs with 3 architecture skills
  
  # Infrastructure & operations
  /plugin install kubernetes-operations       # K8s with 4 deployment skills
  /plugin install cloud-infrastructure        # AWS/Azure/GCP with 4 cloud skills
  
  # Security & quality
  /plugin install security-scanning           # SAST with security skill
  /plugin install code-review-ai             # AI-powered code review
  
  # Full-stack orchestration
  /plugin install full-stack-orchestration   # Multi-agent workflows
  ```
  
  Each installed plugin loads **only its specific agents, commands, and skills** into Claude's context.
  
  ### Plugins vs Agents
  
  You install **plugins**, which bundle agents:
  
  | Plugin                  | Agents                                            |
  | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
  | `comprehensive-review`  | architect-review, code-reviewer, security-auditor |
  | `javascript-typescript` | javascript-pro, typescript-pro                    |
  | `python-development`    | python-pro, django-pro, fastapi-pro               |
  | `blockchain-web3`       | blockchain-developer                              |
  
  ```bash
  # ❌ Wrong - can't install agents directly
  /plugin install typescript-pro
  
  # ✅ Right - install the plugin
  /plugin install javascript-typescript@claude-code-workflows
