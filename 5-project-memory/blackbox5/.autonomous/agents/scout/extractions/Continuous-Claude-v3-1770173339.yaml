  ## Why Continuous Claude?
  
  Claude Code has a **compaction problem**: when context fills up, the system compacts your conversation, losing nuanced understanding and decisions made during the session.
  
  **Continuous Claude solves this with:**
  
  | Problem | Solution |
  |---------|----------|
  | Context loss on compaction | YAML handoffs - more token-efficient transfer |
  | Starting fresh each session | Memory system recalls + daemon auto-extracts learnings |
  | Reading entire files burns tokens | 5-layer code analysis + semantic index |
  | Complex tasks need coordination | Meta-skills orchestrate agent workflows |
  | Repeating workflows manually | 109 skills with natural language triggers |
  
  **The mantra: Compound, don't compact.** Extract learnings automatically, then start fresh with full context.
  
  ### Why "Continuous"? Why "Compounding"?
  
  The name is a pun. **Continuous** because Claude maintains state across sessions. **Compounding** because each session makes the system smarter—learnings accumulate like compound interest.

  ## Design Principles
  
  An agent is five things: **Prompt + Tools + Context + Memory + Model**.
  
  | Component | What We Optimize |
  |-----------|------------------|
  | **Prompt** | Skills inject relevant context; hooks add system reminders |
  | **Tools** | TLDR reduces tokens; agents parallelize work |
  | **Context** | Not just *what* Claude knows, but *how* it's provided |
  | **Memory** | Daemon extracts learnings; recall surfaces them |
  | **Model** | Becomes swappable when the other four are solid |
  
  ### Anti-Complexity
  
  We resist plugin sprawl. Every MCP, subscription, and tool you add promises improvement but risks breaking context, tools, or prompts through clashes.
  
  **Our approach:**
  - **Time, not money** — No required paid services. Perplexity and NIA are optional, high-value-per-token.
  - **Learn, don't accumulate** — A system that learns handles edge cases better than one that collects plugins.
  - **Shift-left validation** — Hooks run pyright/ruff after edits, catching errors before tests.
  
  The failure modes of complex systems are structurally invisible until they happen. A learning, context-efficient system doesn't prevent all failures—but it recovers and improves.

  ## How to Talk to Claude
  
  **You don't need to memorize slash commands.** Just describe what you want naturally.
  
  ### The Skill Activation System
  
  When you send a message, a hook injects context that tells **Claude** which skills and agents are relevant. Claude infers from a rule-based system and decides which tools to use.
