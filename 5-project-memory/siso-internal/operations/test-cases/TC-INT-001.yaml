  description: |
    Tests the full agent spawning pipeline from queue detection
    to actual agent execution. Currently agents are queued but
    not actually spawned - this test verifies the gap.

  preconditions:
    - Spawn queue exists and is accessible
    - Agent definitions are loaded
    - Task tool is available

  steps:
    - "Add agent to spawn queue"
    - "Trigger spawn processor"
    - "Verify agent is spawned via Task tool"
    - "Verify agent execution begins"
    - "Verify completion tracking"

  expected_result: |
    Agent is successfully spawned via Task tool, executes its
    assigned task, and completion is properly tracked.

    This test case identifies GAP-004 from test-tracking-system.yaml.
    The infrastructure exists but actual spawning is not implemented.
