# LEARNINGS - User Profile Epic Creation

**Run:** run-20260118_160000

## What Worked Well

1. **Task Granularity** - Breaking into 18 tasks enabled parallel development
2. **Dependency Mapping** - Visual dependency map helped identify blockers
3. **Architecture First** - Having clear architecture before tasks saved time

## Challenges

1. **Estimation** - Initial estimates may be optimistic
2. **Integration Points** - Clerk/Supabase integration complexity underestimated

## Patterns Discovered

1. **Atomic Tasks** - Tasks should be completable in 2-4 hours
2. **Dependency Chains** - Longest chain determines minimum timeline
3. **Integration Tasks** - Need separate tasks for integration testing

## Improvements for Next Time

1. Add buffer time for integration complexity
2. Include testing tasks in breakdown
3. Create task templates for common patterns
