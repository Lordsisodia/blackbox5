# LEARNINGS - User Profile PRD Creation

**Run:** run-20260118_143000

---

## What Worked Well

1. **4D Research Framework** - Having research pre-done made PRD creation faster
2. **Template Usage** - Using the PRD template ensured consistency
3. **Incremental AC Creation** - Breaking ACs by requirement kept them organized

## Challenges

1. **NFR Overlap** - Some NFRs (security, privacy) had overlapping concerns
2. **AC Granularity** - Deciding on right level of detail for ACs required iteration

## Improvements for Next Time

1. Create AC template examples for common patterns
2. Add NFR categorization to avoid overlap
3. Include estimated complexity with each AC
