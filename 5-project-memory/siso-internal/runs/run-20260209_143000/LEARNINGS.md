# LEARNINGS - BlackBox5 Structure Alignment

**Run:** run-20260209_143000

---

## What Worked Well

1. **Reference Structure** - Having BlackBox5 as reference made alignment straightforward
2. **Existing Content** - SISO-Internal had rich history to base example runs on
3. **Consistent Naming** - Following BlackBox5 naming conventions ensures compatibility

## Challenges

1. **Folder Depth** - Some BlackBox5 folders were empty; had to decide whether to include
2. **Content Generation** - Creating realistic example content required research
3. **Documentation** - Each folder needs README to explain purpose

## Patterns Discovered

1. **Structure Consistency** - Matching structure across projects enables cross-project tools
2. **Example Content** - Example runs help future agents understand expected format
3. **README Everywhere** - Every folder should have README for discoverability

## Improvements for Future

1. Create script to verify structure alignment
2. Add structure validation to CI/CD
3. Document structure decisions in first_principles/
