# LEARNINGS - Project Memory Migration

**Run:** run-20260119_100000

---

## What Worked Well

1. **Question-Based Organization** - Much more intuitive than file-type organization
2. **YAGNI Principle** - Removing empty folders reduced clutter
3. **Root-Level Status Files** - ACTIVE.md and WORK-LOG.md provide instant context

## Challenges

1. **File Classification** - Some files fit multiple categories
2. **Reference Updates** - Many internal references needed updating
3. **Migration Time** - Took longer than expected due to edge cases

## Key Insights

1. **Folder Count Matters** - 18 folders was overwhelming, 6 is manageable
2. **Consistency is Key** - All projects should use same structure
3. **Documentation Required** - README files essential for navigation

## Patterns for Future

1. Start with 6-folder structure for new projects
2. Document decisions as they are made
3. Regular cleanup to prevent accumulation
