# Product Planning

## Purpose

Transform feature ideas into actionable requirements that developers can implement.

## Identity

## Command: plan

### Input
- `feature_description`: What to build
- `target_users`: Who it's for
- `constraints`: Limitations

### Process

1. **Understand user needs**
   - Who are the users?
   - What problem are they solving?
   - Current workarounds?

2. **Define scope**
   - What's in scope?
   - What's explicitly out?
   - MVP vs future phases?

3. **Write user stories**
   - As a [user], I want [goal], so that [benefit]
   - Acceptance criteria for each

4. **Create PRD**
   - Overview
   - User stories
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Non-functional requirements
   - Open questions

5. **Prioritize**
   - Must have
   - Should have
   - Nice to have

### Output

```yaml
prd:
  title: "User Profile Feature"
  version: "1.0"
  date: "2026-01-30"

  overview: |
    Allow users to view and edit their profile information
    including name, avatar, and preferences.

  user_stories:
    - id: "US-001"
      story: "As a user, I want to view my profile"
      acceptance_criteria:
        - "Display name, email, avatar"
        - "Show join date"
        - "Load in < 2 seconds"
      priority: "must"

    - id: "US-002"
      story: "As a user, I want to edit my profile"
      acceptance_criteria:
        - "Edit name and avatar"
        - "Validate inputs"
        - "Save changes"
      priority: "must"

  non_functional_requirements:
    - "Page load < 2s"
    - "Mobile responsive"
    - "Accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA)"

  open_questions:
    - "Avatar file size limit?"
    - "Supported image formats?"

  priority:
    must_have: ["US-001", "US-002"]
    should_have: ["US-003"]
    nice_to_have: ["US-004"]

  confidence: 90
```
