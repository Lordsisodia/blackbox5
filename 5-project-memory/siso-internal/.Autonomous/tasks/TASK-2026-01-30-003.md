first_principles:
  deconstruct: "Testing the skill discovery system requires a real task to see if Legacy can correctly select and invoke skills. The fundamental truth is that the system must work without human intervention."
  question: "Will Legacy correctly identify which skills to use? Will the trigger matching work? Is the documentation clear enough for an AI to follow?"
  approach: "Create a realistic task, simulate Legacy's thought process, identify friction points, optimize the system."
  validation: "Legacy completes the task using appropriate skills, documentation is clear, no human clarification needed."

# Test Skill Discovery System

## Objective
Create a test workflow that verifies the skill discovery system works end-to-end by implementing a simple feature.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Legacy correctly selects skills based on task triggers
- [ ] Skill invocation format is clear and actionable
- [ ] Documentation provides sufficient context
- [ ] No human intervention required
- [ ] Results documented in run folder

## Implementation Notes

This is a meta-task to test the system itself. The actual implementation should be simple (e.g., create a utility function) to focus on testing the skill discovery mechanism.

## Context

We're testing whether the skill system we built actually works for an autonomous AI. This will reveal:
1. Whether triggers are correctly defined
2. Whether skill documentation is actionable
3. Whether the flow is intuitive
4. What friction points exist
