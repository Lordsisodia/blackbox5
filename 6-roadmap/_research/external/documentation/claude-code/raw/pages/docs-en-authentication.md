Setting up Claude Code requires access to Anthropic models. For teams, you can set up Claude Code access in one of these ways:

- [Claude for Teams or Enterprise](#claude-for-teams-or-enterprise) (recommended)

- [Claude Console](#claude-console-authentication)

- [Amazon Bedrock](/docs/en/amazon-bedrock)

- [Google Vertex AI](/docs/en/google-vertex-ai)

- [Microsoft Foundry](/docs/en/microsoft-foundry)

### [​](#claude-for-teams-or-enterprise)Claude for Teams or Enterprise

[Claude for Teams](https://claude.com/pricing#team-&-enterprise) and [Claude for Enterprise](https://anthropic.com/contact-sales) provide the best experience for organizations using Claude Code. Team members get access to both Claude Code and Claude on the web with centralized billing and team management.

- **Claude for Teams**: self-service plan with collaboration features, admin tools, and billing management. Best for smaller teams.

- **Claude for Enterprise**: adds SSO, domain capture, role-based permissions, compliance API, and managed policy settings for organization-wide Claude Code configurations. Best for larger organizations with security and compliance requirements.

## [​](#credential-management)Credential management

Claude Code securely manages your authentication credentials:

- **Storage location**: on macOS, API keys, OAuth tokens, and other credentials are stored in the encrypted macOS Keychain.

- **Supported authentication types**: Claude.ai credentials, Claude API credentials, Azure Auth, Bedrock Auth, and Vertex Auth.

- **Custom credential scripts**: the [`apiKeyHelper`](/docs/en/settings#available-settings) setting can be configured to run a shell script that returns an API key.

- **Refresh intervals**: by default, `apiKeyHelper` is called after 5 minutes or on HTTP 401 response. Set `CLAUDE_CODE_API_KEY_HELPER_TTL_MS` environment variable for custom refresh intervals.
