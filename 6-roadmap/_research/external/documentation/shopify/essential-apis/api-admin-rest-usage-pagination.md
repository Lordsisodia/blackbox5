# Make paginated requests to the REST Admin APIAsk assistantLegacyThe REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. All apps and integrations should be built with the [GraphQL Admin API](/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).**Legacy:** The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. All apps and integrations should be built with the [GraphQL Admin API](/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).REST endpoints support cursor-based pagination. This guide illustrates how to request paginated data from the REST Admin API and access each page of results.

## [Anchor to How it works](/docs/api/admin-rest/usage/pagination#how-it-works)How it worksWhen you send a request to a REST endpoint that supports cursor-based pagination, the response body returns the first page of results. If applicable, then a response header returns links to the next page and the previous page of results. You can use the links in the response header to iterate through the pages of results.### [Anchor to Link header syntax](/docs/api/admin-rest/usage/pagination#link-header-syntax)Link header syntaxLink headers use the following syntax:## Link header syntax9123#...link: "`https://{shop}.myshopify.com/admin/api/{api_version}/customers.json?page_info={page_info}&limit={limit}`; rel={next}, `https://{shop}.myshopify.com/admin/api/{api_version}/customers.json?page_info={page_info}&limit={limit}`; rel={previous}"#...The link header includes a `rel` parameter that describes the relation of the linked page to the current page of results. The value can either be `previous` or `next`. If your initial request doesn't return enough records to generate an additional page of results, then the response won't have a link header.#### [Anchor to Parameters](/docs/api/admin-rest/usage/pagination#parameters)ParametersThe URL in the link header can include the following parameters:| Parameter | Description || `page_info` | A unique ID used to access a certain page of results. The `page_info` parameter can't be modified and must be used exactly as it appears in the link header URL. || `limit` | The maximum number of results to show on the page:- The default `limit` value is `50`.- The maximum `limit` value is `250`. || `fields` | A comma-separated list of which fields to show in the results. This parameter only works for some endpoints. |

## [Anchor to Supported endpoints](/docs/api/admin-rest/usage/pagination#supported-endpoints)Supported endpointsYou can use cursor-based pagination on most [REST Admin API](/docs/api/admin-rest) GET endpoints that retrieve a list of resources.If the REST resource includes the `limit` parameter on the GET endpoint, then you can use the endpoint to request paginated data. For example, the `Customer` resource includes the `limit` parameter on the [GET endpoint that retrieves a list of customers](/docs/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/customer#get-customers).TipYou can use the `since_id` parameter that's available on endpoints that support cursor-based pagination to make requests from a specific point. For example, you can use the `since_id` parameter on the [`Transaction`](/docs/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/transaction) resource to retrieve only transactions after a specified ID.**Tip:** You can use the `since_id` parameter that's available on endpoints that support cursor-based pagination to make requests from a specific point. For example, you can use the `since_id` parameter on the [`Transaction`](/docs/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/transaction) resource to retrieve only transactions after a specified ID.

## [Anchor to Make a request for paginated data](/docs/api/admin-rest/usage/pagination#make-a-request-for-paginated-data)Make a request for paginated dataWhen you make a request to an endpoint that supports paginated results, you can set the number of results to return per page using the `limit` parameter. If you don't specify a `limit`, then the endpoint will use its [default page limit](#parameters). You can also set other parameters in this request to narrow down your results.The following example request asks the product endpoint for all customers, with a `limit` of 3 customers per page of results:## GET https## Response headerCopy9123#...link: "`https://{shop}.myshopify.com/admin/api/{api_version}/customers.json?page_info=hijgklmn&limit=3`; rel=next"#...## JSON responseCopy91234567{  "customers": [    {"id": 1},    {"id": 2},    {"id": 3}  ]}The response header returns a link header that includes a URL for the next page of results. The response body returns the first page of results, which includes 3 customers.

## [Anchor to Retrieve the next page of results](/docs/api/admin-rest/usage/pagination#retrieve-the-next-page-of-results)Retrieve the next page of resultsTo get the next page of results, you can make a request to the URL stored in the link header of the [last response](#make-a-request-for-paginated-data).NoteBecause the request URL contains the `page_info` parameter, you can't add any other parameters to the request, except for `limit`. Including other parameters can cause the request to fail.**Note:** Because the request URL contains the `page_info` parameter, you can't add any other parameters to the request, except for `limit`. Including other parameters can cause the request to fail.## GET https## Response headerCopy9123#...Link: "`https://{shop}.myshopify.com/admin/api/{api_version}/customers.json?page_info=abcdefg&limit=3`; rel=previous, `https://{shop}.myshopify.com/admin/api/{api_version}/customers.json?page_info=opqrstu&limit=3`; rel=next"#...## JSON responseCopy91234567{  "customers": [    {"id": 4},    {"id": 5},    {"id": 6}  ]}The response header includes a link to the previous page of results and a link to the next page. The response body includes the second page of results, which includes the next 3 customers after the first page.You can use the URLs in the link headers to iterate through each page of results. If you make a request to a page, and the response header only includes a link to the previous page, then you've reached the last page of results.

## [Anchor to Change the number of results for a specific page](/docs/api/admin-rest/usage/pagination#change-the-number-of-results-for-a-specific-page)Change the number of results for a specific pageYou can change the `limit` in a link header URL to return a different number of results from a specified point. For example, the following example request asks the product endpoint for all customers, with a `limit` parameter of 3:## GET https## Response headerCopy9123#...link: "`https://{shop}.myshopify.com/admin/api/{api_version}/customers.json?page_info=hijgklmn&limit=3`; rel=next"#...## JSON responseCopy91234567{  "customers": [    {"id": 1},    {"id": 2},    {"id": 3}  ]}If you change the `limit` in the URL in the link header to 6 and make a request to that URL, then the response body returns the 6 customers after the first page of results:## GET https## Response headerCopy9123#...link: "`https://{shop}.myshopify.com/admin/api/{api_version}/customers.json?page_info=vwxyzab&limit=6`; rel=next"#...## JSON responseCopy9912345678910{  "customers": [    {"id": 4},    {"id": 5},    {"id": 6},    {"id": 7},    {"id": 8},    {"id": 9}  ]}

## [Anchor to Use the shopify-api npm library](/docs/api/admin-rest/usage/pagination#use-the-shopify-api-npm-library)Use the shopify-api npm libraryThe [`@shopify/shopify-api` library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shopify/shopify-api) provides backend support for JavaScript and TypeScript apps to access the REST Admin API.### [Anchor to Example](/docs/api/admin-rest/usage/pagination#example)ExampleThe following code retrieves customers from a store by fetching them in batches of 10 until all customers have been retrieved. You can store the `pageInfo` data between requests using a session.## Retrieve more than one set of customersCopy9912345678910111213let pageInfo;do {  const response = await shopify.rest.Customer.all({    ...pageInfo?.nextPage?.query,    session,    limit: 10,  });  const pageCustomers = response.data;  // Use pageCustomers as needed  pageInfo = response.pageInfo;} while (pageInfo?.nextPage);NoteEach request returns the information required for an app to request the previous or next set of items. For REST resources, calls to the `all` method return the information that's necessary to make those requests in the `pageInfo` property.**Note:** Each request returns the information required for an app to request the previous or next set of items. For REST resources, calls to the `all` method return the information that's necessary to make those requests in the `pageInfo` property.

## [Anchor to Limitations and considerations](/docs/api/admin-rest/usage/pagination#limitations-and-considerations)Limitations and considerations

- A request that includes the `page_info` parameter can't include any other parameters except for `limit` and `fields` (if it applies to the endpoint). If you want your results to be filtered by other parameters, then you need to include those parameters in the first request you make.

- The link header URLs are temporary and we don't recommend saving them to use later. Use link header URLs only while working with the request that generated them.

- Any request that sends the `page` parameter will return an error.

TipPaginating resources using a [range search](/docs/api/usage/search-syntax#search-query-syntax) might timeout or return an error if the collection of resources is sufficiently large, and the search field is different from the specified (or default) sort order. If your query is slow or returns an error, then try specifying a sort order that matches the field used in the search. For example, `/admin/orders.json?created_at_min=2020-10-21&order=created_at`.**Tip:** Paginating resources using a [range search](/docs/api/usage/search-syntax#search-query-syntax) might timeout or return an error if the collection of resources is sufficiently large, and the search field is different from the specified (or default) sort order.
