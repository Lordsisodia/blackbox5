# About Shopify App BridgeAsk assistantThe App Bridge library provides APIs that enable Shopify apps to render UI in the Shopify [app home](/docs/apps/build/admin) surface.Apps built with Shopify App Bridge are more performant, flexible, and seamlessly integrate with the Shopify admin. You can use Shopify App Bridge with [Polaris](/docs/api/polaris) to provide a consistent and intuitive user experience that matches the rest of the Shopify admin.On the web, your app renders in an iframe and in the [Shopify mobile app](https://www.shopify.com/install) it renders in a WebView.NoteApp Bridge components don't render as part of the app's component hierarchy. They're React-like wrappers around JavaScript messages that communicate with the Shopify admin. The Shopify admin does the UI rendering.**Note:** App Bridge components don't render as part of the app's component hierarchy. They're React-like wrappers around JavaScript messages that communicate with the Shopify admin. The Shopify admin does the UI rendering.App Bridge enables you to do the following from your app home:

-

Render a [navigation menu](/docs/api/app-home/app-bridge-web-components/app-nav) on the left of the Shopify admin.

-

Render a [save bar](/docs/api/app-home/apis/save-bar) above the top bar of the Shopify admin.

-

Render a [title bar](/docs/api/app-home/app-bridge-web-components/title-bar) with primary and secondary actions.

The latest version of App Bridge is built on top of web components and APIs to provide a flexible and familiar development environment. Your app can invoke these [APIs](/docs/api/app-home) using vanilla JavaScript functions.

## [Anchor to Polaris](/docs/api/app-bridge/index#polaris)PolarisInside the app surface, we encourage you to use [Polaris](/docs/api/polaris) so you create familiar and consistent user experiences between your app and the Shopify admin. You can refer to the [App Design Guidelines](/docs/apps/design-guidelines) to create familiar and consistent user experiences.
