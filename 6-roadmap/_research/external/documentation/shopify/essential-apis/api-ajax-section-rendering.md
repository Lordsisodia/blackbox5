# Section Rendering API

# Section Rendering APIAsk assistantYou can use the Section Rendering API to request the HTML markup for theme sections using an AJAX request. This can allow you to update page content without reloading the entire page by fetching and dynamically replacing only certain elements.For example, you can use the Section Rendering API to paginate search results without performing a full page reload between pages.TipIf you want to use the Section Rendering API to update a page based on changes to the cart, then you should consider [bundled section rendering](/docs/api/ajax/reference/cart#bundled-section-rendering).**Tip:** If you want to use the Section Rendering API to update a page based on changes to the cart, then you should consider [bundled section rendering](/docs/api/ajax/reference/cart#bundled-section-rendering).

## [Anchor to Request sections](/docs/api/ajax/section-rendering#request-sections)Request sectionsYou can use the `sections` query parameter to render up to five sections, identified by their [section IDs](#find-section-ids). The response is a JSON object that includes pairs for each section ID and its corresponding rendered HTML.The `sections` parameter can be a comma-separated list of IDs or an array:## ExampleCopy912?sections=main-password-header,sections--1234__header?sections[]=main-password-header&sections[]=sections--1234__headerSections can be rendered in the context of any page by appending the `sections` parameter to any page URL. For example, you can request `/?sections=sections--1234__header` for the root page, or you can request `/collections/featured?sections=sections--1234__header` for a featured collection page.NoteYou can't specify section setting values through the Section Rendering API. If a requested section exists in a template, or is statically rendered, then the existing section settings apply. Otherwise, any default values are used.**Note:** You can't specify section setting values through the Section Rendering API. If a requested section exists in a template, or is statically rendered, then the existing section settings apply. Otherwise, any default values are used.The following example code requests two sections using a JavaScript `XMLHttpRequest`:## ExampleCopy9123456789function handleResponse() {  JSON.parse(this.responseText);}const request = new XMLHttpRequest();request.addEventListener('load', handleResponse);request.open('GET', '/?sections=main-password-header,sections--1234__header', true);request.send();## Response textCopy91234{  "header":"<div id=\"shopify-section-main-password-header\" className=\"shopify-section\">\n<!-- section content -->\n</div>",  "footer":"<div id=\"shopify-section-sections--1234__header\" className=\"shopify-section shopify-section-group-header-group\">\n<!-- section content -->\n</div>"}TipAny query parameters that are respected when rendering the full page, such as `q` or `page`, are also respected when sections are rendered.**Tip:** Any query parameters that are respected when rendering the full page, such as `q` or `page`, are also respected when sections are rendered.### [Anchor to Sections error response](/docs/api/ajax/section-rendering#sections-error-response)Sections error responseSections that fail to render, including those that fail because they do not exist for the published theme, are returned as `null` in the JSON response. A response might have an HTTP 200 status, but still include one or more sections that failed to render. Because of this, you should account for the possibility of `null` sections.

## [Anchor to Request a single section](/docs/api/ajax/section-rendering#request-a-single-section)Request a single sectionYou can use the `sections` parameter and its JSON response in most cases, including rendering a single section. As an alternative, you can use the `section_id` query parameter to request a single section.## ExampleCopy91?section_id=main-password-headerSections rendered in response to the `section_id` query parameter are returned directly as HTML and, like `sections`, this parameter can be used to render a section in the context of any page.NoteYou can't specify section setting values through the Section Rendering API. If a requested section exists in a template, or is statically rendered, then the existing section settings apply. Otherwise, any default values are used.**Note:** You can't specify section setting values through the Section Rendering API. If a requested section exists in a template, or is statically rendered, then the existing section settings apply. Otherwise, any default values are used.### [Anchor to Single section error response](/docs/api/ajax/section-rendering#single-section-error-response)Single section error responseIf the requested section ID doesn’t exist on the theme, then the server responds with a `404` status.

## [Anchor to Find section IDs](/docs/api/ajax/section-rendering#find-section-ids)Find section IDsYou can access a section ID in two ways:

- Through the Liquid [`section` object](/docs/api/liquid/objects/section), using `section.id`

- [Extract it](#extract-a-section-id-from-the-wrapper) from the ID attribute of the section wrapper

TipIf you want to reference a statically rendered section, then the section ID is the file name. For example, if you had a `social.liquid` section, then the ID would be `social`.**Tip:** If you want to reference a statically rendered section, then the section ID is the file name. For example, if you had a `social.liquid` section, then the ID would be `social`.### [Anchor to Extract a section ID from the wrapper](/docs/api/ajax/section-rendering#extract-a-section-id-from-the-wrapper)Extract a section ID from the wrapperYou can extract a section ID from the ID attribute of the section wrapper. For example, the following is the general format for a section wrapper:## Section wrapper formatCopy9123<div id="shopify-section-[section-id]" className="shopify-section">  <!-- section content --></div>If a section is included in a [JSON template](/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/templates/json-templates) or a [section group](/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/section-groups), then it's assigned a dynamic section ID. Dynamic section IDs ensure no two sections of the same type have the same ID.For example, a section inside of a section group might have an ID of `sections--1234__header`, and a section inside of a JSON template might have an ID of `template--5678__image_banner`.

## [Anchor to Locale-aware URLs](/docs/api/ajax/section-rendering#locale-aware-urls)Locale-aware URLsStores can have [dynamic URLs](/docs/storefronts/themes/markets/multiple-currencies-languages#locale-aware-urls) generated for them when they sell internationally or in multiple languages. When using the Section Rendering API, it’s important to use dynamic, locale-aware URLs so that you can give visitors a consistent experience for the language and country that they’ve chosen.The global value `window.Shopify.routes.root` is available to use as a base when building locale-aware URLs in JavaScript:## Loading a section in the context of the rootCopy912fetch(window.Shopify.routes.root + "?sections={section-id}")  .then(res => res.json())Alternatively, a section can be loaded in the context of the current page by using [`window.location.pathname`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Location/pathname) as a base:## Loading a section in the context of the current pageCopy912fetch(window.location.pathname + "?sections={section-id}")  .then(res => res.json())
