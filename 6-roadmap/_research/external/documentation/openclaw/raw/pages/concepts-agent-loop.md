An agentic loop is the full “real” run of an agent: intake → context assembly → model inference →

tool execution → streaming replies → persistence. It’s the authoritative path that turns a message

into actions and a final reply, while keeping session state consistent.

In OpenClaw, a loop is a single, serialized run per session that emits lifecycle and stream events

as the model thinks, calls tools, and streams output. This doc explains how that authentic loop is

wired end-to-end.

## [​](#entry-points)Entry points

- Gateway RPC: `agent` and `agent.wait`.

- CLI: `agent` command.

## [​](#how-it-works-high-level)How it works (high-level)

- `agent` RPC validates params, resolves session (sessionKey/sessionId), persists session metadata, returns `{ runId, acceptedAt }` immediately.

- `agentCommand` runs the agent:

resolves model + thinking/verbose defaults

- loads skills snapshot

- calls `runEmbeddedPiAgent` (pi-agent-core runtime)

- emits **lifecycle end/error** if the embedded loop does not emit one

- `runEmbeddedPiAgent`:

serializes runs via per-session + global queues

- resolves model + auth profile and builds the pi session

- subscribes to pi events and streams assistant/tool deltas

- enforces timeout -> aborts run if exceeded

- returns payloads + usage metadata

- `subscribeEmbeddedPiSession` bridges pi-agent-core events to OpenClaw `agent` stream:

tool events => `stream: "tool"`

- assistant deltas => `stream: "assistant"`

- lifecycle events => `stream: "lifecycle"` (`phase: "start" | "end" | "error"`)

- `agent.wait` uses `waitForAgentJob`:

waits for **lifecycle end/error** for `runId`

- returns `{ status: ok|error|timeout, startedAt, endedAt, error? }`

## [​](#queueing-+-concurrency)Queueing + concurrency

- Runs are serialized per session key (session lane) and optionally through a global lane.

- This prevents tool/session races and keeps session history consistent.

- Messaging channels can choose queue modes (collect/steer/followup) that feed this lane system.

See [Command Queue](/concepts/queue).

## [​](#session-+-workspace-preparation)Session + workspace preparation

- Workspace is resolved and created; sandboxed runs may redirect to a sandbox workspace root.

- Skills are loaded (or reused from a snapshot) and injected into env and prompt.

- Bootstrap/context files are resolved and injected into the system prompt report.

- A session write lock is acquired; `SessionManager` is opened and prepared before streaming.

## [​](#prompt-assembly-+-system-prompt)Prompt assembly + system prompt

- System prompt is built from OpenClaw’s base prompt, skills prompt, bootstrap context, and per-run overrides.

- Model-specific limits and compaction reserve tokens are enforced.

- See [System prompt](/concepts/system-prompt) for what the model sees.

## [​](#hook-points-where-you-can-intercept)Hook points (where you can intercept)

OpenClaw has two hook systems:

- **Internal hooks** (Gateway hooks): event-driven scripts for commands and lifecycle events.

- **Plugin hooks**: extension points inside the agent/tool lifecycle and gateway pipeline.

### [​](#internal-hooks-gateway-hooks)Internal hooks (Gateway hooks)

- **`agent:bootstrap`**: runs while building bootstrap files before the system prompt is finalized.

Use this to add/remove bootstrap context files.

- **Command hooks**: `/new`, `/reset`, `/stop`, and other command events (see Hooks doc).

See [Hooks](/hooks) for setup and examples.

### [​](#plugin-hooks-agent-+-gateway-lifecycle)Plugin hooks (agent + gateway lifecycle)

These run inside the agent loop or gateway pipeline:

- **`before_agent_start`**: inject context or override system prompt before the run starts.

- **`agent_end`**: inspect the final message list and run metadata after completion.

- **`before_compaction` / `after_compaction`**: observe or annotate compaction cycles.

- **`before_tool_call` / `after_tool_call`**: intercept tool params/results.

- **`tool_result_persist`**: synchronously transform tool results before they are written to the session transcript.

- **`message_received` / `message_sending` / `message_sent`**: inbound + outbound message hooks.

- **`session_start` / `session_end`**: session lifecycle boundaries.

- **`gateway_start` / `gateway_stop`**: gateway lifecycle events.

See [Plugins](/plugin#plugin-hooks) for the hook API and registration details.

## [​](#streaming-+-partial-replies)Streaming + partial replies

- Assistant deltas are streamed from pi-agent-core and emitted as `assistant` events.

- Block streaming can emit partial replies either on `text_end` or `message_end`.

- Reasoning streaming can be emitted as a separate stream or as block replies.

- See [Streaming](/concepts/streaming) for chunking and block reply behavior.

## [​](#tool-execution-+-messaging-tools)Tool execution + messaging tools

- Tool start/update/end events are emitted on the `tool` stream.

- Tool results are sanitized for size and image payloads before logging/emitting.

- Messaging tool sends are tracked to suppress duplicate assistant confirmations.

## [​](#reply-shaping-+-suppression)Reply shaping + suppression

- Final payloads are assembled from:

assistant text (and optional reasoning)

- inline tool summaries (when verbose + allowed)

- assistant error text when the model errors

- `NO_REPLY` is treated as a silent token and filtered from outgoing payloads.

- Messaging tool duplicates are removed from the final payload list.

- If no renderable payloads remain and a tool errored, a fallback tool error reply is emitted

(unless a messaging tool already sent a user-visible reply).

## [​](#compaction-+-retries)Compaction + retries

- Auto-compaction emits `compaction` stream events and can trigger a retry.

- On retry, in-memory buffers and tool summaries are reset to avoid duplicate output.

- See [Compaction](/concepts/compaction) for the compaction pipeline.

## [​](#event-streams-today)Event streams (today)

- `lifecycle`: emitted by `subscribeEmbeddedPiSession` (and as a fallback by `agentCommand`)

- `assistant`: streamed deltas from pi-agent-core

- `tool`: streamed tool events from pi-agent-core

## [​](#chat-channel-handling)Chat channel handling

- Assistant deltas are buffered into chat `delta` messages.

- A chat `final` is emitted on **lifecycle end/error**.

## [​](#timeouts)Timeouts

- `agent.wait` default: 30s (just the wait). `timeoutMs` param overrides.

- Agent runtime: `agents.defaults.timeoutSeconds` default 600s; enforced in `runEmbeddedPiAgent` abort timer.

## [​](#where-things-can-end-early)Where things can end early

- Agent timeout (abort)

- AbortSignal (cancel)

- Gateway disconnect or RPC timeout

- `agent.wait` timeout (wait-only, does not stop agent)
