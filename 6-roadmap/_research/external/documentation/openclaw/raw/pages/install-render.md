The included `render.yaml` Blueprint defines your entire stack declaratively, service, disk, environment variables, so you can deploy with a single click and version your infrastructure alongside your code.

## [​](#prerequisites)Prerequisites

- A [Render account](https://render.com) (free tier available)

- An API key from your preferred [model provider](/providers)

## [​](#deploy-with-a-render-blueprint)Deploy with a Render Blueprint

[Deploy to Render](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)

Clicking this link will:

- Create a new Render service from the `render.yaml` Blueprint at the root of this repo.

- Prompt you to set `SETUP_PASSWORD`

- Build the Docker image and deploy

Once deployed, your service URL follows the pattern `https://<service-name>.onrender.com`.

## [​](#understanding-the-blueprint)Understanding the Blueprint

Render Blueprints are YAML files that define your infrastructure. The `render.yaml` in this

repository configures everything needed to run OpenClaw:

Copy```

services:

- type: web

name: openclaw

runtime: docker

plan: starter

healthCheckPath: /health

envVars:

- key: PORT

value: "8080"

- key: SETUP_PASSWORD

sync: false # prompts during deploy

- key: OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR

value: /data/.openclaw

- key: OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE_DIR

value: /data/workspace

- key: OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN

generateValue: true # auto-generates a secure token

disk:

name: openclaw-data

mountPath: /data

sizeGB: 1

```

Key Blueprint features used:

FeaturePurpose`runtime: docker`Builds from the repo’s Dockerfile`healthCheckPath`Render monitors `/health` and restarts unhealthy instances`sync: false`Prompts for value during deploy (secrets)`generateValue: true`Auto-generates a cryptographically secure value`disk`Persistent storage that survives redeploys

## [​](#choosing-a-plan)Choosing a plan

PlanSpin-downDiskBest forFreeAfter 15 min idleNot availableTesting, demosStarterNever1GB+Personal use, small teamsStandard+Never1GB+Production, multiple channels

The Blueprint defaults to `starter`. To use free tier, change `plan: free` in your fork’s

`render.yaml` (but note: no persistent disk means config resets on each deploy).

## [​](#after-deployment)After deployment

### [​](#complete-the-setup-wizard)Complete the setup wizard

- Navigate to `https://<your-service>.onrender.com/setup`

- Enter your `SETUP_PASSWORD`

- Select a model provider and paste your API key

- Optionally configure messaging channels (Telegram, Discord, Slack)

- Click **Run setup**

### [​](#access-the-control-ui)Access the Control UI

The web dashboard is available at `https://<your-service>.onrender.com/openclaw`.

## [​](#render-dashboard-features)Render Dashboard features

### [​](#logs)Logs

View real-time logs in **Dashboard → your service → Logs**. Filter by:

- Build logs (Docker image creation)

- Deploy logs (service startup)

- Runtime logs (application output)

### [​](#shell-access)Shell access

For debugging, open a shell session via **Dashboard → your service → Shell**. The persistent disk is mounted at `/data`.

### [​](#environment-variables)Environment variables

Modify variables in **Dashboard → your service → Environment**. Changes trigger an automatic redeploy.

### [​](#auto-deploy)Auto-deploy

If you use the original OpenClaw repository, Render will not auto-deploy your OpenClaw. To update it, run a manual Blueprint sync from the dashboard.

## [​](#custom-domain)Custom domain

- Go to **Dashboard → your service → Settings → Custom Domains**

- Add your domain

- Configure DNS as instructed (CNAME to `*.onrender.com`)

- Render provisions a TLS certificate automatically

## [​](#scaling)Scaling

Render supports horizontal and vertical scaling:

- **Vertical**: Change the plan to get more CPU/RAM

- **Horizontal**: Increase instance count (Standard plan and above)

For OpenClaw, vertical scaling is usually sufficient. Horizontal scaling requires sticky sessions or external state management.

## [​](#backups-and-migration)Backups and migration

Export your configuration and workspace at any time:

Copy```

https://<your-service>.onrender.com/setup/export

```

This downloads a portable backup you can restore on any OpenClaw host.

## [​](#troubleshooting)Troubleshooting

### [​](#service-won’t-start)Service won’t start

Check the deploy logs in the Render Dashboard. Common issues:

- Missing `SETUP_PASSWORD` — the Blueprint prompts for this, but verify it’s set

- Port mismatch — ensure `PORT=8080` matches the Dockerfile’s exposed port

### [​](#slow-cold-starts-free-tier)Slow cold starts (free tier)

Free tier services spin down after 15 minutes of inactivity. The first request after spin-down takes a few seconds while the container starts. Upgrade to Starter plan for always-on.

### [​](#data-loss-after-redeploy)Data loss after redeploy

This happens on free tier (no persistent disk). Upgrade to a paid plan, or

regularly export your config via `/setup/export`.

### [​](#health-check-failures)Health check failures

Render expects a 200 response from `/health` within 30 seconds. If builds succeed but deploys fail, the service may be taking too long to start. Check:

- Build logs for errors

- Whether the container runs locally with `docker build && docker run`
