The macOS app is the **menu‑bar companion** for OpenClaw. It owns permissions,

manages/attaches to the Gateway locally (launchd or manual), and exposes macOS

capabilities to the agent as a node.

## [​](#what-it-does)What it does

- Shows native notifications and status in the menu bar.

- Owns TCC prompts (Notifications, Accessibility, Screen Recording, Microphone,

Speech Recognition, Automation/AppleScript).

- Runs or connects to the Gateway (local or remote).

- Exposes macOS‑only tools (Canvas, Camera, Screen Recording, `system.run`).

- Starts the local node host service in **remote** mode (launchd), and stops it in **local** mode.

- Optionally hosts **PeekabooBridge** for UI automation.

- Installs the global CLI (`openclaw`) via npm/pnpm on request (bun not recommended for the Gateway runtime).

## [​](#local-vs-remote-mode)Local vs remote mode

- **Local** (default): the app attaches to a running local Gateway if present;

otherwise it enables the launchd service via `openclaw gateway install`.

- **Remote**: the app connects to a Gateway over SSH/Tailscale and never starts

a local process.

The app starts the local **node host service** so the remote Gateway can reach this Mac.

The app does not spawn the Gateway as a child process.

## [​](#launchd-control)Launchd control

The app manages a per‑user LaunchAgent labeled `bot.molt.gateway`

(or `bot.molt.<profile>` when using `--profile`/`OPENCLAW_PROFILE`; legacy `com.openclaw.*` still unloads).

Copy```

launchctl kickstart -k gui/$UID/bot.molt.gateway

launchctl bootout gui/$UID/bot.molt.gateway

```

Replace the label with `bot.molt.<profile>` when running a named profile.

If the LaunchAgent isn’t installed, enable it from the app or run

`openclaw gateway install`.

## [​](#node-capabilities-mac)Node capabilities (mac)

The macOS app presents itself as a node. Common commands:

- Canvas: `canvas.present`, `canvas.navigate`, `canvas.eval`, `canvas.snapshot`, `canvas.a2ui.*`

- Camera: `camera.snap`, `camera.clip`

- Screen: `screen.record`

- System: `system.run`, `system.notify`

The node reports a `permissions` map so agents can decide what’s allowed.

Node service + app IPC:

- When the headless node host service is running (remote mode), it connects to the Gateway WS as a node.

- `system.run` executes in the macOS app (UI/TCC context) over a local Unix socket; prompts + output stay in-app.

Diagram (SCI):

|  IPC (UDS + token + HMAC + TTL)

```

## [​](#exec-approvals-system-run)Exec approvals (system.run)

`system.run` is controlled by **Exec approvals** in the macOS app (Settings → Exec approvals).

Security + ask + allowlist are stored locally on the Mac in:

Copy```

~/.openclaw/exec-approvals.json

```

Example:

Copy```

{

"version": 1,

"defaults": {

"security": "deny",

"ask": "on-miss"

},

"agents": {

"main": {

"security": "allowlist",

"ask": "on-miss",

"allowlist": [{ "pattern": "/opt/homebrew/bin/rg" }]

}

}

}

```

Notes:

- `allowlist` entries are glob patterns for resolved binary paths.

- Choosing “Always Allow” in the prompt adds that command to the allowlist.

- `system.run` environment overrides are filtered (drops `PATH`, `DYLD_*`, `LD_*`, `NODE_OPTIONS`, `PYTHON*`, `PERL*`, `RUBYOPT`) and then merged with the app’s environment.

## [​](#deep-links)Deep links

The app registers the `openclaw://` URL scheme for local actions.

### [​](#openclaw//agent)`openclaw://agent`

Triggers a Gateway `agent` request.

Copy```

open 'openclaw://agent?message=Hello%20from%20deep%20link'

```

Query parameters:

- `message` (required)

- `sessionKey` (optional)

- `thinking` (optional)

- `deliver` / `to` / `channel` (optional)

- `timeoutSeconds` (optional)

- `key` (optional unattended mode key)

Safety:

- Without `key`, the app prompts for confirmation.

- With a valid `key`, the run is unattended (intended for personal automations).

## [​](#onboarding-flow-typical)Onboarding flow (typical)

- Install and launch **OpenClaw.app**.

- Complete the permissions checklist (TCC prompts).

- Ensure **Local** mode is active and the Gateway is running.

- Install the CLI if you want terminal access.

## [​](#build-&-dev-workflow-native)Build & dev workflow (native)

- `cd apps/macos && swift build`

- `swift run OpenClaw` (or Xcode)

- Package app: `scripts/package-mac-app.sh`

## [​](#debug-gateway-connectivity-macos-cli)Debug gateway connectivity (macOS CLI)

Use the debug CLI to exercise the same Gateway WebSocket handshake and discovery

logic that the macOS app uses, without launching the app.

Copy```

cd apps/macos

swift run openclaw-mac connect --json

swift run openclaw-mac discover --timeout 3000 --json

```

Connect options:

- `--url <ws://host:port>`: override config

- `--mode <local|remote>`: resolve from config (default: config or local)

- `--probe`: force a fresh health probe

- `--timeout <ms>`: request timeout (default: `15000`)

- `--json`: structured output for diffing

Discovery options:

- `--include-local`: include gateways that would be filtered as “local”

- `--timeout <ms>`: overall discovery window (default: `2000`)

- `--json`: structured output for diffing

Tip: compare against `openclaw gateway discover --json` to see whether the

macOS app’s discovery pipeline (NWBrowser + tailnet DNS‑SD fallback) differs from

the Node CLI’s `dns-sd` based discovery.

## [​](#remote-connection-plumbing-ssh-tunnels)Remote connection plumbing (SSH tunnels)

When the macOS app runs in **Remote** mode, it opens an SSH tunnel so local UI

components can talk to a remote Gateway as if it were on localhost.

### [​](#control-tunnel-gateway-websocket-port)Control tunnel (Gateway WebSocket port)

- **Purpose:** health checks, status, Web Chat, config, and other control-plane calls.

- **Local port:** the Gateway port (default `18789`), always stable.

- **Remote port:** the same Gateway port on the remote host.

- **Behavior:** no random local port; the app reuses an existing healthy tunnel

or restarts it if needed.

- **SSH shape:** `ssh -N -L <local>:127.0.0.1:<remote>` with BatchMode +

ExitOnForwardFailure + keepalive options.

- **IP reporting:** the SSH tunnel uses loopback, so the gateway will see the node

IP as `127.0.0.1`. Use **Direct (ws/wss)** transport if you want the real client

IP to appear (see [macOS remote access](/platforms/mac/remote)).

For setup steps, see [macOS remote access](/platforms/mac/remote). For protocol

details, see [Gateway protocol](/gateway/protocol).
