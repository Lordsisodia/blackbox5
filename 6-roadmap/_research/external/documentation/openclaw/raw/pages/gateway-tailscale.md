OpenClaw can auto-configure Tailscale **Serve** (tailnet) or **Funnel** (public) for the

Gateway dashboard and WebSocket port. This keeps the Gateway bound to loopback while

Tailscale provides HTTPS, routing, and (for Serve) identity headers.

## [​](#modes)Modes

- `serve`: Tailnet-only Serve via `tailscale serve`. The gateway stays on `127.0.0.1`.

- `funnel`: Public HTTPS via `tailscale funnel`. OpenClaw requires a shared password.

- `off`: Default (no Tailscale automation).

## [​](#auth)Auth

Set `gateway.auth.mode` to control the handshake:

- `token` (default when `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` is set)

- `password` (shared secret via `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PASSWORD` or config)

When `tailscale.mode = "serve"` and `gateway.auth.allowTailscale` is `true`,

valid Serve proxy requests can authenticate via Tailscale identity headers

(`tailscale-user-login`) without supplying a token/password. OpenClaw verifies

the identity by resolving the `x-forwarded-for` address via the local Tailscale

daemon (`tailscale whois`) and matching it to the header before accepting it.

OpenClaw only treats a request as Serve when it arrives from loopback with

Tailscale’s `x-forwarded-for`, `x-forwarded-proto`, and `x-forwarded-host`

headers.

To require explicit credentials, set `gateway.auth.allowTailscale: false` or

force `gateway.auth.mode: "password"`.

## [​](#config-examples)Config examples

### [​](#tailnet-only-serve)Tailnet-only (Serve)

Copy```

{

gateway: {

bind: "loopback",

tailscale: { mode: "serve" },

},

}

```

Open: `https://<magicdns>/` (or your configured `gateway.controlUi.basePath`)

### [​](#tailnet-only-bind-to-tailnet-ip)Tailnet-only (bind to Tailnet IP)

Use this when you want the Gateway to listen directly on the Tailnet IP (no Serve/Funnel).

Copy```

{

gateway: {

bind: "tailnet",

auth: { mode: "token", token: "your-token" },

},

}

```

Connect from another Tailnet device:

- Control UI: `http://<tailscale-ip>:18789/`

- WebSocket: `ws://<tailscale-ip>:18789`

Note: loopback (`http://127.0.0.1:18789`) will **not** work in this mode.

### [​](#public-internet-funnel-+-shared-password)Public internet (Funnel + shared password)

Copy```

{

gateway: {

bind: "loopback",

tailscale: { mode: "funnel" },

auth: { mode: "password", password: "replace-me" },

},

}

```

Prefer `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PASSWORD` over committing a password to disk.

## [​](#cli-examples)CLI examples

Copy```

openclaw gateway --tailscale serve

openclaw gateway --tailscale funnel --auth password

```

## [​](#notes)Notes

- Tailscale Serve/Funnel requires the `tailscale` CLI to be installed and logged in.

- `tailscale.mode: "funnel"` refuses to start unless auth mode is `password` to avoid public exposure.

- Set `gateway.tailscale.resetOnExit` if you want OpenClaw to undo `tailscale serve`

or `tailscale funnel` configuration on shutdown.

- `gateway.bind: "tailnet"` is a direct Tailnet bind (no HTTPS, no Serve/Funnel).

- `gateway.bind: "auto"` prefers loopback; use `tailnet` if you want Tailnet-only.

- Serve/Funnel only expose the **Gateway control UI + WS**. Nodes connect over

the same Gateway WS endpoint, so Serve can work for node access.

## [​](#browser-control-remote-gateway-+-local-browser)Browser control (remote Gateway + local browser)

If you run the Gateway on one machine but want to drive a browser on another machine,

run a **node host** on the browser machine and keep both on the same tailnet.

The Gateway will proxy browser actions to the node; no separate control server or Serve URL needed.

Avoid Funnel for browser control; treat node pairing like operator access.

## [​](#tailscale-prerequisites-+-limits)Tailscale prerequisites + limits

- Serve requires HTTPS enabled for your tailnet; the CLI prompts if it is missing.

- Serve injects Tailscale identity headers; Funnel does not.

- Funnel requires Tailscale v1.38.3+, MagicDNS, HTTPS enabled, and a funnel node attribute.

- Funnel only supports ports `443`, `8443`, and `10000` over TLS.

- Funnel on macOS requires the open-source Tailscale app variant.
