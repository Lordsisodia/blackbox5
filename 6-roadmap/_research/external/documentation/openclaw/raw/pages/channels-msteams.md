“Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.”

Updated: 2026-01-21

Status: text + DM attachments are supported; channel/group file sending requires `sharePointSiteId` + Graph permissions (see [Sending files in group chats](#sending-files-in-group-chats)). Polls are sent via Adaptive Cards.

## [​](#plugin-required)Plugin required

Microsoft Teams ships as a plugin and is not bundled with the core install.

**Breaking change (2026.1.15):** MS Teams moved out of core. If you use it, you must install the plugin.

Explainable: keeps core installs lighter and lets MS Teams dependencies update independently.

Install via CLI (npm registry):

Copy```

openclaw plugins install @openclaw/msteams

```

Local checkout (when running from a git repo):

Copy```

openclaw plugins install ./extensions/msteams

```

If you choose Teams during configure/onboarding and a git checkout is detected,

OpenClaw will offer the local install path automatically.

Details: [Plugins](/plugin)

## [​](#quick-setup-beginner)Quick setup (beginner)

- Install the Microsoft Teams plugin.

- Create an **Azure Bot** (App ID + client secret + tenant ID).

- Configure OpenClaw with those credentials.

- Expose `/api/messages` (port 3978 by default) via a public URL or tunnel.

- Install the Teams app package and start the gateway.

Minimal config:

Copy```

{

channels: {

msteams: {

enabled: true,

appId: "<APP_ID>",

appPassword: "<APP_PASSWORD>",

tenantId: "<TENANT_ID>",

webhook: { port: 3978, path: "/api/messages" },

},

},

}

```

Note: group chats are blocked by default (`channels.msteams.groupPolicy: "allowlist"`). To allow group replies, set `channels.msteams.groupAllowFrom` (or use `groupPolicy: "open"` to allow any member, mention-gated).

## [​](#goals)Goals

- Talk to OpenClaw via Teams DMs, group chats, or channels.

- Keep routing deterministic: replies always go back to the channel they arrived on.

- Default to safe channel behavior (mentions required unless configured otherwise).

## [​](#config-writes)Config writes

By default, Microsoft Teams is allowed to write config updates triggered by `/config set|unset` (requires `commands.config: true`).

Disable with:

Copy```

{

channels: { msteams: { configWrites: false } },

}

```

## [​](#access-control-dms-+-groups)Access control (DMs + groups)

**DM access**

- Default: `channels.msteams.dmPolicy = "pairing"`. Unknown senders are ignored until approved.

- `channels.msteams.allowFrom` accepts AAD object IDs, UPNs, or display names. The wizard resolves names to IDs via Microsoft Graph when credentials allow.

**Group access**

- Default: `channels.msteams.groupPolicy = "allowlist"` (blocked unless you add `groupAllowFrom`). Use `channels.defaults.groupPolicy` to override the default when unset.

- `channels.msteams.groupAllowFrom` controls which senders can trigger in group chats/channels (falls back to `channels.msteams.allowFrom`).

- Set `groupPolicy: "open"` to allow any member (still mention‑gated by default).

- To allow **no channels**, set `channels.msteams.groupPolicy: "disabled"`.

Example:

Copy```

{

channels: {

msteams: {

groupPolicy: "allowlist",

groupAllowFrom: ["[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)"],

},

},

}

```

**Teams + channel allowlist**

- Scope group/channel replies by listing teams and channels under `channels.msteams.teams`.

- Keys can be team IDs or names; channel keys can be conversation IDs or names.

- When `groupPolicy="allowlist"` and a teams allowlist is present, only listed teams/channels are accepted (mention‑gated).

- The configure wizard accepts `Team/Channel` entries and stores them for you.

- On startup, OpenClaw resolves team/channel and user allowlist names to IDs (when Graph permissions allow)

and logs the mapping; unresolved entries are kept as typed.

Example:

Copy```

{

channels: {

msteams: {

groupPolicy: "allowlist",

teams: {

"My Team": {

channels: {

General: { requireMention: true },

},

},

},

},

},

}

```

## [​](#how-it-works)How it works

- Install the Microsoft Teams plugin.

- Create an **Azure Bot** (App ID + secret + tenant ID).

- Build a **Teams app package** that references the bot and includes the RSC permissions below.

- Upload/install the Teams app into a team (or personal scope for DMs).

- Configure `msteams` in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` (or env vars) and start the gateway.

- The gateway listens for Bot Framework webhook traffic on `/api/messages` by default.

## [​](#azure-bot-setup-prerequisites)Azure Bot Setup (Prerequisites)

Before configuring OpenClaw, you need to create an Azure Bot resource.

### [​](#step-1-create-azure-bot)Step 1: Create Azure Bot

-

Go to [Create Azure Bot](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.AzureBot)

-

Fill in the **Basics** tab:

FieldValue**Bot handle**Your bot name, e.g., `openclaw-msteams` (must be unique)**Subscription**Select your Azure subscription**Resource group**Create new or use existing**Pricing tier****Free** for dev/testing**Type of App****Single Tenant** (recommended - see note below)**Creation type****Create new Microsoft App ID**

**Deprecation notice:** Creation of new multi-tenant bots was deprecated after 2025-07-31. Use **Single Tenant** for new bots.

- Click **Review + create** → **Create** (wait ~1-2 minutes)

### [​](#step-2-get-credentials)Step 2: Get Credentials

- Go to your Azure Bot resource → **Configuration**

- Copy **Microsoft App ID** → this is your `appId`

- Click **Manage Password** → go to the App Registration

- Under **Certificates & secrets** → **New client secret** → copy the **Value** → this is your `appPassword`

- Go to **Overview** → copy **Directory (tenant) ID** → this is your `tenantId`

### [​](#step-3-configure-messaging-endpoint)Step 3: Configure Messaging Endpoint

- In Azure Bot → **Configuration**

- Set **Messaging endpoint** to your webhook URL:

Production: `https://your-domain.com/api/messages`

- Local dev: Use a tunnel (see [Local Development](#local-development-tunneling) below)

### [​](#step-4-enable-teams-channel)Step 4: Enable Teams Channel

- In Azure Bot → **Channels**

- Click **Microsoft Teams** → Configure → Save

- Accept the Terms of Service

## [​](#local-development-tunneling)Local Development (Tunneling)

Teams can’t reach `localhost`. Use a tunnel for local development:

**Option A: ngrok**

Copy```

ngrok http 3978

# Copy the https URL, e.g., https://abc123.ngrok.io

# Set messaging endpoint to: https://abc123.ngrok.io/api/messages

```

**Option B: Tailscale Funnel**

Copy```

tailscale funnel 3978

# Use your Tailscale funnel URL as the messaging endpoint

```

## [​](#teams-developer-portal-alternative)Teams Developer Portal (Alternative)

Instead of manually creating a manifest ZIP, you can use the [Teams Developer Portal](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/apps):

- Click **+ New app**

- Fill in basic info (name, description, developer info)

- Go to **App features** → **Bot**

- Select **Enter a bot ID manually** and paste your Azure Bot App ID

- Check scopes: **Personal**, **Team**, **Group Chat**

- Click **Distribute** → **Download app package**

- In Teams: **Apps** → **Manage your apps** → **Upload a custom app** → select the ZIP

This is often easier than hand-editing JSON manifests.

## [​](#testing-the-bot)Testing the Bot

**Option A: Azure Web Chat (verify webhook first)**

- In Azure Portal → your Azure Bot resource → **Test in Web Chat**

- Send a message - you should see a response

- This confirms your webhook endpoint works before Teams setup

**Option B: Teams (after app installation)**

- Install the Teams app (sideload or org catalog)

- Find the bot in Teams and send a DM

- Check gateway logs for incoming activity

## [​](#setup-minimal-text-only)Setup (minimal text-only)

-

**Install the Microsoft Teams plugin**

From npm: `openclaw plugins install @openclaw/msteams`

- From a local checkout: `openclaw plugins install ./extensions/msteams`

-

**Bot registration**

Create an Azure Bot (see above) and note:

App ID

- Client secret (App password)

- Tenant ID (single-tenant)

-

**Teams app manifest**

Include a `bot` entry with `botId = <App ID>`.

- Scopes: `personal`, `team`, `groupChat`.

- `supportsFiles: true` (required for personal scope file handling).

- Add RSC permissions (below).

- Create icons: `outline.png` (32x32) and `color.png` (192x192).

- Zip all three files together: `manifest.json`, `outline.png`, `color.png`.

-

**Configure OpenClaw**

Copy```

{

"msteams": {

"enabled": true,

"appId": "<APP_ID>",

"appPassword": "<APP_PASSWORD>",

"tenantId": "<TENANT_ID>",

"webhook": { "port": 3978, "path": "/api/messages" }

}

}

```

You can also use environment variables instead of config keys:

`MSTEAMS_APP_ID`

- `MSTEAMS_APP_PASSWORD`

- `MSTEAMS_TENANT_ID`

-

**Bot endpoint**

Set the Azure Bot Messaging Endpoint to:

`https://<host>:3978/api/messages` (or your chosen path/port).

-

**Run the gateway**

The Teams channel starts automatically when the plugin is installed and `msteams` config exists with credentials.

## [​](#history-context)History context

- `channels.msteams.historyLimit` controls how many recent channel/group messages are wrapped into the prompt.

- Falls back to `messages.groupChat.historyLimit`. Set `0` to disable (default 50).

- DM history can be limited with `channels.msteams.dmHistoryLimit` (user turns). Per-user overrides: `channels.msteams.dms["<user_id>"].historyLimit`.

## [​](#current-teams-rsc-permissions-manifest)Current Teams RSC Permissions (Manifest)

These are the **existing resourceSpecific permissions** in our Teams app manifest. They only apply inside the team/chat where the app is installed.

**For channels (team scope):**

- `ChannelMessage.Read.Group` (Application) - receive all channel messages without @mention

- `ChannelMessage.Send.Group` (Application)

- `Member.Read.Group` (Application)

- `Owner.Read.Group` (Application)

- `ChannelSettings.Read.Group` (Application)

- `TeamMember.Read.Group` (Application)

- `TeamSettings.Read.Group` (Application)

**For group chats:**

- `ChatMessage.Read.Chat` (Application) - receive all group chat messages without @mention

## [​](#example-teams-manifest-redacted)Example Teams Manifest (redacted)

}

}

}

```

### [​](#manifest-caveats-must-have-fields)Manifest caveats (must-have fields)

- `bots[].botId` **must** match the Azure Bot App ID.

- `webApplicationInfo.id` **must** match the Azure Bot App ID.

- `bots[].scopes` must include the surfaces you plan to use (`personal`, `team`, `groupChat`).

- `bots[].supportsFiles: true` is required for file handling in personal scope.

- `authorization.permissions.resourceSpecific` must include channel read/send if you want channel traffic.

### [​](#updating-an-existing-app)Updating an existing app

To update an already-installed Teams app (e.g., to add RSC permissions):

- Update your `manifest.json` with the new settings

- **Increment the `version` field** (e.g., `1.0.0` → `1.1.0`)

- **Re-zip** the manifest with icons (`manifest.json`, `outline.png`, `color.png`)

- Upload the new zip:

**Option A (Teams Admin Center):** Teams Admin Center → Teams apps → Manage apps → find your app → Upload new version

- **Option B (Sideload):** In Teams → Apps → Manage your apps → Upload a custom app

- **For team channels:** Reinstall the app in each team for new permissions to take effect

- **Fully quit and relaunch Teams** (not just close the window) to clear cached app metadata

## [​](#capabilities-rsc-only-vs-graph)Capabilities: RSC only vs Graph

### [​](#with-teams-rsc-only-app-installed-no-graph-api-permissions)With **Teams RSC only** (app installed, no Graph API permissions)

Works:

- Read channel message **text** content.

- Send channel message **text** content.

- Receive **personal (DM)** file attachments.

Does NOT work:

- Channel/group **image or file contents** (payload only includes HTML stub).

- Downloading attachments stored in SharePoint/OneDrive.

- Reading message history (beyond the live webhook event).

### [​](#with-teams-rsc-+-microsoft-graph-application-permissions)With **Teams RSC + Microsoft Graph Application permissions**

Adds:

- Downloading hosted contents (images pasted into messages).

- Downloading file attachments stored in SharePoint/OneDrive.

- Reading channel/chat message history via Graph.

### [​](#rsc-vs-graph-api)RSC vs Graph API

CapabilityRSC PermissionsGraph API**Real-time messages**Yes (via webhook)No (polling only)**Historical messages**NoYes (can query history)**Setup complexity**App manifest onlyRequires admin consent + token flow**Works offline**No (must be running)Yes (query anytime)

**Bottom line:** RSC is for real-time listening; Graph API is for historical access. For catching up on missed messages while offline, you need Graph API with `ChannelMessage.Read.All` (requires admin consent).

## [​](#graph-enabled-media-+-history-required-for-channels)Graph-enabled media + history (required for channels)

If you need images/files in **channels** or want to fetch **message history**, you must enable Microsoft Graph permissions and grant admin consent.

- In Entra ID (Azure AD) **App Registration**, add Microsoft Graph **Application permissions**:

`ChannelMessage.Read.All` (channel attachments + history)

- `Chat.Read.All` or `ChatMessage.Read.All` (group chats)

- **Grant admin consent** for the tenant.

- Bump the Teams app **manifest version**, re-upload, and **reinstall the app in Teams**.

- **Fully quit and relaunch Teams** to clear cached app metadata.

## [​](#known-limitations)Known Limitations

### [​](#webhook-timeouts)Webhook timeouts

Teams delivers messages via HTTP webhook. If processing takes too long (e.g., slow LLM responses), you may see:

- Gateway timeouts

- Teams retrying the message (causing duplicates)

- Dropped replies

OpenClaw handles this by returning quickly and sending replies proactively, but very slow responses may still cause issues.

### [​](#formatting)Formatting

Teams markdown is more limited than Slack or Discord:

- Basic formatting works: **bold**, *italic*, `code`, links

- Complex markdown (tables, nested lists) may not render correctly

- Adaptive Cards are supported for polls and arbitrary card sends (see below)

## [​](#configuration)Configuration

Key settings (see `/gateway/configuration` for shared channel patterns):

- `channels.msteams.enabled`: enable/disable the channel.

- `channels.msteams.appId`, `channels.msteams.appPassword`, `channels.msteams.tenantId`: bot credentials.

- `channels.msteams.webhook.port` (default `3978`)

- `channels.msteams.webhook.path` (default `/api/messages`)

- `channels.msteams.dmPolicy`: `pairing | allowlist | open | disabled` (default: pairing)

- `channels.msteams.allowFrom`: allowlist for DMs (AAD object IDs, UPNs, or display names). The wizard resolves names to IDs during setup when Graph access is available.

- `channels.msteams.textChunkLimit`: outbound text chunk size.

- `channels.msteams.chunkMode`: `length` (default) or `newline` to split on blank lines (paragraph boundaries) before length chunking.

- `channels.msteams.mediaAllowHosts`: allowlist for inbound attachment hosts (defaults to Microsoft/Teams domains).

- `channels.msteams.mediaAuthAllowHosts`: allowlist for attaching Authorization headers on media retries (defaults to Graph + Bot Framework hosts).

- `channels.msteams.requireMention`: require @mention in channels/groups (default true).

- `channels.msteams.replyStyle`: `thread | top-level` (see [Reply Style](#reply-style-threads-vs-posts)).

- `channels.msteams.teams.<teamId>.replyStyle`: per-team override.

- `channels.msteams.teams.<teamId>.requireMention`: per-team override.

- `channels.msteams.teams.<teamId>.tools`: default per-team tool policy overrides (`allow`/`deny`/`alsoAllow`) used when a channel override is missing.

- `channels.msteams.teams.<teamId>.toolsBySender`: default per-team per-sender tool policy overrides (`"*"` wildcard supported).

- `channels.msteams.teams.<teamId>.channels.<conversationId>.replyStyle`: per-channel override.

- `channels.msteams.teams.<teamId>.channels.<conversationId>.requireMention`: per-channel override.

- `channels.msteams.teams.<teamId>.channels.<conversationId>.tools`: per-channel tool policy overrides (`allow`/`deny`/`alsoAllow`).

- `channels.msteams.teams.<teamId>.channels.<conversationId>.toolsBySender`: per-channel per-sender tool policy overrides (`"*"` wildcard supported).

- `channels.msteams.sharePointSiteId`: SharePoint site ID for file uploads in group chats/channels (see [Sending files in group chats](#sending-files-in-group-chats)).

## [​](#routing-&-sessions)Routing & Sessions

- Session keys follow the standard agent format (see [/concepts/session](/concepts/session)):

Direct messages share the main session (`agent:<agentId>:<mainKey>`).

- Channel/group messages use conversation id:

`agent:<agentId>:msteams:channel:<conversationId>`

- `agent:<agentId>:msteams:group:<conversationId>`

## [​](#reply-style-threads-vs-posts)Reply Style: Threads vs Posts

Teams recently introduced two channel UI styles over the same underlying data model:

StyleDescriptionRecommended `replyStyle`**Posts** (classic)Messages appear as cards with threaded replies underneath`thread` (default)**Threads** (Slack-like)Messages flow linearly, more like Slack`top-level`

**The problem:** The Teams API does not expose which UI style a channel uses. If you use the wrong `replyStyle`:

- `thread` in a Threads-style channel → replies appear nested awkwardly

- `top-level` in a Posts-style channel → replies appear as separate top-level posts instead of in-thread

**Solution:** Configure `replyStyle` per-channel based on how the channel is set up:

Copy```

{

"msteams": {

"replyStyle": "thread",

"teams": {

"19:[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)": {

"channels": {

"19:[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)": {

"replyStyle": "top-level"

}

}

}

}

}

}

```

## [​](#attachments-&-images)Attachments & Images

**Current limitations:**

- **DMs:** Images and file attachments work via Teams bot file APIs.

- **Channels/groups:** Attachments live in M365 storage (SharePoint/OneDrive). The webhook payload only includes an HTML stub, not the actual file bytes. **Graph API permissions are required** to download channel attachments.

Without Graph permissions, channel messages with images will be received as text-only (the image content is not accessible to the bot).

By default, OpenClaw only downloads media from Microsoft/Teams hostnames. Override with `channels.msteams.mediaAllowHosts` (use `["*"]` to allow any host).

Authorization headers are only attached for hosts in `channels.msteams.mediaAuthAllowHosts` (defaults to Graph + Bot Framework hosts). Keep this list strict (avoid multi-tenant suffixes).

## [​](#sending-files-in-group-chats)Sending files in group chats

Bots can send files in DMs using the FileConsentCard flow (built-in). However, **sending files in group chats/channels** requires additional setup:

ContextHow files are sentSetup needed**DMs**FileConsentCard → user accepts → bot uploadsWorks out of the box**Group chats/channels**Upload to SharePoint → share linkRequires `sharePointSiteId` + Graph permissions**Images (any context)**Base64-encoded inlineWorks out of the box

### [​](#why-group-chats-need-sharepoint)Why group chats need SharePoint

Bots don’t have a personal OneDrive drive (the `/me/drive` Graph API endpoint doesn’t work for application identities). To send files in group chats/channels, the bot uploads to a **SharePoint site** and creates a sharing link.

### [​](#setup)Setup

-

**Add Graph API permissions** in Entra ID (Azure AD) → App Registration:

`Sites.ReadWrite.All` (Application) - upload files to SharePoint

- `Chat.Read.All` (Application) - optional, enables per-user sharing links

-

**Grant admin consent** for the tenant.

-

**Get your SharePoint site ID:**

Copy```

# Via Graph Explorer or curl with a valid token:

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \

"https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/sites/{hostname}:/{site-path}"

# Example: for a site at "contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/BotFiles"

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \

"https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/sites/contoso.sharepoint.com:/sites/BotFiles"

# Response includes: "id": "contoso.sharepoint.com,guid1,guid2"

```

-

**Configure OpenClaw:**

Copy```

{

channels: {

msteams: {

// ... other config ...

sharePointSiteId: "contoso.sharepoint.com,guid1,guid2",

},

},

}

```

### [​](#sharing-behavior)Sharing behavior

PermissionSharing behavior`Sites.ReadWrite.All` onlyOrganization-wide sharing link (anyone in org can access)`Sites.ReadWrite.All` + `Chat.Read.All`Per-user sharing link (only chat members can access)

Per-user sharing is more secure as only the chat participants can access the file. If `Chat.Read.All` permission is missing, the bot falls back to organization-wide sharing.

### [​](#fallback-behavior)Fallback behavior

ScenarioResultGroup chat + file + `sharePointSiteId` configuredUpload to SharePoint, send sharing linkGroup chat + file + no `sharePointSiteId`Attempt OneDrive upload (may fail), send text onlyPersonal chat + fileFileConsentCard flow (works without SharePoint)Any context + imageBase64-encoded inline (works without SharePoint)

### [​](#files-stored-location)Files stored location

Uploaded files are stored in a `/OpenClawShared/` folder in the configured SharePoint site’s default document library.

## [​](#polls-adaptive-cards)Polls (Adaptive Cards)

OpenClaw sends Teams polls as Adaptive Cards (there is no native Teams poll API).

- CLI: `openclaw message poll --channel msteams --target conversation:<id> ...`

- Votes are recorded by the gateway in `~/.openclaw/msteams-polls.json`.

- The gateway must stay online to record votes.

- Polls do not auto-post result summaries yet (inspect the store file if needed).

## [​](#adaptive-cards-arbitrary)Adaptive Cards (arbitrary)

Send any Adaptive Card JSON to Teams users or conversations using the `message` tool or CLI.

The `card` parameter accepts an Adaptive Card JSON object. When `card` is provided, the message text is optional.

**Agent tool:**

Copy```

{

"action": "send",

"channel": "msteams",

"target": "user:<id>",

"card": {

"type": "AdaptiveCard",

"version": "1.5",

"body": [{ "type": "TextBlock", "text": "Hello!" }]

}

}

```

**CLI:**

Copy```

openclaw message send --channel msteams \

--target "conversation:19:[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)" \

--card '{"type":"AdaptiveCard","version":"1.5","body":[{"type":"TextBlock","text":"Hello!"}]}'

```

See [Adaptive Cards documentation](https://adaptivecards.io/) for card schema and examples. For target format details, see [Target formats](#target-formats) below.

## [​](#target-formats)Target formats

MSTeams targets use prefixes to distinguish between users and conversations:

Target typeFormatExampleUser (by ID)`user:<aad-object-id>``user:40a1a0ed-4ff2-4164-a219-55518990c197`User (by name)`user:<display-name>``user:John Smith` (requires Graph API)Group/channel`conversation:<conversation-id>``conversation:19:[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)`Group/channel (raw)`<conversation-id>``19:[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)` (if contains `@thread`)

**CLI examples:**

Copy```

# Send to a user by ID

openclaw message send --channel msteams --target "user:40a1a0ed-..." --message "Hello"

# Send to a user by display name (triggers Graph API lookup)

openclaw message send --channel msteams --target "user:John Smith" --message "Hello"

# Send to a group chat or channel

openclaw message send --channel msteams --target "conversation:19:[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)" --message "Hello"

# Send an Adaptive Card to a conversation

openclaw message send --channel msteams --target "conversation:19:[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)" \

--card '{"type":"AdaptiveCard","version":"1.5","body":[{"type":"TextBlock","text":"Hello"}]}'

```

**Agent tool examples:**

Copy```

{

"action": "send",

"channel": "msteams",

"target": "user:John Smith",

"message": "Hello!"

}

```

Copy```

{

"action": "send",

"channel": "msteams",

"target": "conversation:19:[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)",

"card": {

"type": "AdaptiveCard",

"version": "1.5",

"body": [{ "type": "TextBlock", "text": "Hello" }]

}

}

```

Note: Without the `user:` prefix, names default to group/team resolution. Always use `user:` when targeting people by display name.

## [​](#proactive-messaging)Proactive messaging

- Proactive messages are only possible **after** a user has interacted, because we store conversation references at that point.

- See `/gateway/configuration` for `dmPolicy` and allowlist gating.

## [​](#team-and-channel-ids-common-gotcha)Team and Channel IDs (Common Gotcha)

The `groupId` query parameter in Teams URLs is **NOT** the team ID used for configuration. Extract IDs from the URL path instead:

**Team URL:**

Copy```

https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3ABk4j...%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=...

└────────────────────────────┘

Team ID (URL-decode this)

```

**Channel URL:**

Copy```

https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3A15bc...%40thread.tacv2/ChannelName?groupId=...

└─────────────────────────┘

Channel ID (URL-decode this)

```

**For config:**

- Team ID = path segment after `/team/` (URL-decoded, e.g., `19:[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)`)

- Channel ID = path segment after `/channel/` (URL-decoded)

- **Ignore** the `groupId` query parameter

## [​](#private-channels)Private Channels

Bots have limited support in private channels:

FeatureStandard ChannelsPrivate ChannelsBot installationYesLimitedReal-time messages (webhook)YesMay not workRSC permissionsYesMay behave differently@mentionsYesIf bot is accessibleGraph API historyYesYes (with permissions)

**Workarounds if private channels don’t work:**

- Use standard channels for bot interactions

- Use DMs - users can always message the bot directly

- Use Graph API for historical access (requires `ChannelMessage.Read.All`)

## [​](#troubleshooting)Troubleshooting

### [​](#common-issues)Common issues

- **Images not showing in channels:** Graph permissions or admin consent missing. Reinstall the Teams app and fully quit/reopen Teams.

- **No responses in channel:** mentions are required by default; set `channels.msteams.requireMention=false` or configure per team/channel.

- **Version mismatch (Teams still shows old manifest):** remove + re-add the app and fully quit Teams to refresh.

- **401 Unauthorized from webhook:** Expected when testing manually without Azure JWT - means endpoint is reachable but auth failed. Use Azure Web Chat to test properly.

### [​](#manifest-upload-errors)Manifest upload errors

- **“Icon file cannot be empty”:** The manifest references icon files that are 0 bytes. Create valid PNG icons (32x32 for `outline.png`, 192x192 for `color.png`).

- **“webApplicationInfo.Id already in use”:** The app is still installed in another team/chat. Find and uninstall it first, or wait 5-10 minutes for propagation.

- **“Something went wrong” on upload:** Upload via [https://admin.teams.microsoft.com](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com) instead, open browser DevTools (F12) → Network tab, and check the response body for the actual error.

- **Sideload failing:** Try “Upload an app to your org’s app catalog” instead of “Upload a custom app” - this often bypasses sideload restrictions.

### [​](#rsc-permissions-not-working)RSC permissions not working

- Verify `webApplicationInfo.id` matches your bot’s App ID exactly

- Re-upload the app and reinstall in the team/chat

- Check if your org admin has blocked RSC permissions

- Confirm you’re using the right scope: `ChannelMessage.Read.Group` for teams, `ChatMessage.Read.Chat` for group chats
