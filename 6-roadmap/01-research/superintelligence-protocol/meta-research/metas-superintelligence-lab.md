## Leadership

### Shengjia Zhao - Chief Scientist
- **Background:** Co-creator of GPT-4 and ChatGPT at OpenAI
- **Recruited:** July 2025
- **Role:** Sets research agenda and scientific direction
- **Reports to:** Mark Zuckerberg (direct collaboration)

### Co-Leaders
- **Alexandr Wang** - Ex-Scale AI CEO
- **Nat Friedman** - GitHub founder

### Recruitment Impact
- **12+ senior OpenAI researchers** in 6 weeks
- Entire **18-person DeepMind "self-play" division**
- Key talent from **Google's Pathways team**
- Compensation: **$200-300M over 4 years** (400% above market)

---

## Technical Focus: Recursive Self-Improvement

### Core Capability
The lab is specifically building AI systems that can:
- **Rewrite their own training code** without human intervention
- Continuously enhance capabilities through autonomous self-modification
- Achieve **>95% on Cross-Meta Reasoning (CMR) benchmark**

### Key Innovation
Unlike traditional AI that optimizes parameters, these systems improve their **fundamental reasoning capabilities** through recursive code rewriting.

### Architecture
- **Llama-4-scale model** base
- **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)** architecture
- Natively multimodal
- Agentic capabilities (autonomous action)

## Infrastructure

| Resource | Scale | Timeline |
|----------|-------|----------|
| **GPU Cluster** | 250,000 H100 GPUs | Active |
| **Prometheus Data Center** | 1-gigawatt facility | 2026 |
| **Hyperion** | 5-gigawatt (world's largest) | 2027 |
| **Total Investment** | $70+ billion committed | Ongoing |
| **2024 Spend** | $40+ billion | Completed |

---

## Open-Source Philosophy

### Commitment
- **Every parameter** released
- **Every training recipe** documented
- **Permissive licensing** for all outputs
- **Indemnification** for downstream commercial/research use

### Strategic Goal
Become the "default upstream supplier" for:
- Universities
- Startups
- Nation-states
- Enterprise

**Effect:** Weaponizing openness to commoditize reasoning capabilities across the industry.

## Recent Developments (2025)

### Llama 4 Reception
- Mixed reviews prompted shift to MoE architecture
- Considering skipping "Behemoth" version
- Focus shifting to proprietary models

### Internal Controversies
- Benchmark manipulation allegations
- Leadership restructuring
- Talent retention challenges despite high pay

### Technical Progress
- Self-learning breakthroughs documented
- Path to superintelligence mapped
- Constitutional AI layer proposed for safety

## Safety & Governance

### Proposed Mechanisms
- **Constitutional AI layer** embedded in model checkpoints
- Alignment monitoring systems
- Capability overhang detection

### Concerns
- **Alignment drift:** Self-modifying systems may shift from original objectives
- **Capability overhang:** Small improvements → exponential, uncontrolled gains
- **Regulatory gaps:** Current frameworks assume human oversight

### Open Questions
- How to maintain alignment during recursive self-improvement?
- What happens when system can modify its own safety mechanisms?
- How to prevent runaway intelligence explosion?

## Implications for Superintelligence Protocol

### What We Can Learn
1. **Recursive self-improvement is viable** - Major lab betting on it
2. **Open-source AGI is coming** - Democratized superintelligence
3. **MoE architecture** - Efficient scaling without full parameter activation
4. **Constitutional AI** - Safety embedded at model level

### What to Track
- Llama-4/5 releases
- Self-improvement benchmarks
- Safety mechanism publications
- Open-source model capabilities

### Opportunities
- Build on top of open-weight models
- Implement recursive refinement in BlackBox5
- Contribute to safety research
- Prepare for commoditized reasoning

## Competitive Landscape

| Lab | Approach | Openness | Timeline |
|-----|----------|----------|----------|
| **Meta MSL** | Recursive self-improvement | Full open-source | 2026 AGI |
| **OpenAI** | Test-time compute scaling | Closed | Ongoing |
| **Anthropic** | Interpretability + safety | Partial | Ongoing |
| **Google DeepMind** | Integrated reasoning | Partial | Ongoing |

**Meta's Advantage:** Resources + openness + recursive approach
**Meta's Risk:** Safety challenges with self-modifying systems

---

## Key Metrics to Watch

1. **Cross-Meta Reasoning (CMR) benchmark** - Target: >95%
2. **Self-improvement velocity** - Rate of capability gain
3. **Model scale** - Parameter count, MoE experts
4. **Safety evaluations** - Alignment maintenance during self-modification
5. **Adoption** - Downloads, forks, derivative works

---

## Research Questions

1. How does recursive self-improvement work in practice?
2. What are the safety mechanisms for self-modifying AI?
3. How can we leverage open-weight AGI for BlackBox5?
4. What does commoditized reasoning mean for our architecture?
5. How do we prepare for AGI-level capabilities in 2026?
