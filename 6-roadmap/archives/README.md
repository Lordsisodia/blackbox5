## Archive Contents

Each archive contains:
- Research documents from that period
- Design documents implemented
- Validation results
- Completed plans
- Post-mortems and retrospectives

## Why Archive?

- **Historical Reference** - Understand past decisions
- **Pattern Recognition** - Identify recurring themes
- **Learning** - Learn from past successes/failures
- **Compliance** - Maintain records for audit

## Accessing Archives

Archived items can be referenced but should not be modified. If an archived idea becomes relevant again:

1. Copy to current directory (01-research, 02-design, etc.)
2. Update with current context
3. Mark as "revived from archive"
