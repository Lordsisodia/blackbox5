    ⭐️ In this video, we break down the Claude Code task system and show you how to
    build powerful multi-agent orchestration using two game-changing prompts. This
    isn''t about hype or vibe coding - this is ANTI-HYPE advanced agentic coding that
    actually works.


    🛠️ Learn how to create specialized agent teams with builder agents and validator
    agents working together. Discover how task create, task update, task list, and
    task get tools enable your parallel agents Claude to communicate and coordinate
    like never before. Watch as we set up task dependencies, blockers, and real-time
    agent communication through the Claude tasks system.


    💡 We dive deep into three powerful components: self-validation (agents checking
    their own work), agent orchestration (conducting teams of subagents), and templating
    (teaching agents to build as you would). This is the foundation of true agentic
    coding workflow that separates real engineering from slop engineering.


    🔥 Key takeaways:

    - Build specialized Claude Code subagents that validate their own work

    - Create multi-agent orchestration with builder and validator agent pairs

    - Use the task system for reliable agent-to-agent communication

    - Template meta prompts that generate consistent, vetted prompts

    - Scale your agentic coding with organized, purpose-driven agent teams


    🌟 Whether you''re building AI coding assistants, research tools, or complex agentic
    workflows, understanding the Claude Code task system is critical. Don''t get distracted
    by the hype - stay close to the fundamentals and learn the primitives that make
    agents actually work.

  full_text: We're entering a new paradigm of agentic coding. And I'm not talking
    about the very powerful but very dangerous maltbot or previously cloudbot. More
    on that later. I'm talking about new tools for engineers to orchestrate intelligence.
    The new cla code task system is going under the radar in a massive way, probably
    because of all the cloud pot hype. But this feature hints at the future of engineering
    work. I have two prompts to show you that you can use to extend your ability to
    build with agents and it's all based on this new cloud code task system. This
    changes the workflow of engineering in a pretty significant way and really it's
    not getting enough attention. So I want to focus on this in a very anti-hype way.
    I have one metaprompt and one plan to share with you that can really push what
    you can do with agents in a cloud code instance. We will slash plan, but this
    isn't an ordinary plan. We're going to plan with a team. We have a user prompt
    and an orchestrator prompt. I'm going to jump through this and fill this out.
    Paste and paste. I'll explain what this does further on. Feel free to pause the
    video if you want. I'll fire this off. This prompt will showcase you can now reliably
    and consistently create teams of agents. More agents, more autonomy, and more
    compute doesn't always mean better outcomes. What we want is more organized agents
    that can communicate together to work toward a common goal. If you want to understand
    how to use the cloud code task system at scale reliably and consistently to create
    teams of agents, stick around and let's jump right in. Let's take a look at plan
    with team. This isn't like most prompts you've seen. This prompt has three powerful
    components to it. Self- validation, agent orchestration, and templating. The first
    thing you'll notice here is that we have hooks in the front matter. This agent
    is self validating. In fact, it has specialized scripts that it uses to validate
    its own work. You can see here we have validate new file and we have validate
    file contains. So on the stop hook once this agent finishes running, it's going
    to make sure that it created a file of a specific type in a specific directory
    and it's going to make sure that it contains specific content. This is very powerful.
    Now we know for a fact that this plan was created. And in fact, we should be able
    to see that right now. If we close this, we can see that our plan has been created
    and it's been validated. And so now the next step is we're going to actually kick
    this off. And you can see our agent has done something really interesting here.
    We have a team task list. Every task has an owner. All right. So this is not an
    ordinary sub aent prompt. This task list has specific team members doing specific
    work all the way through. and we're using two specific types of agents. We're
    going to break down in just a second a builder agent and a validator agent. We're
    going to go ahead and kick off this prompt and we're going to actually start building
    this out. We'll look at the spec. This is the second prompt that we're going to
    look at and we're going to understand why this generated prompt from our meta
    prompt is so unique. Let's just go ahead and kick this off. Get this building
    in the background. We're going to use a /bu prompt. And now you'll notice here
    it is building up that brand new task list. And so it's just going to keep stacking
    on the brand new task list. We're also going to look at the actual tools that
    this agent is running to put together this team of agent and to communicate the
    results. You can see we have five more pending. So a lot of work is getting stacked
    up here. And now we're getting the dependency blockers. Not only is our agent
    planning out work, building a team, it's also setting up the tasks and the order
    that the tasks need to operate in. So you can see here our first five or six tasks.
    These can run in parallel. They're building out the brand new hooks. And so to
    be clear here, what we're doing is I have this code base on my repo cloud code
    hooks mastery. Last update was five or six months ago. So we're going to go ahead
    and update the documentation and update some of the code. Right? So this is a
    very common engineering workflow that you would run that you would enhance with
    agents. You need to update old code to update and reflect changes and new documentation.
    So that's what we're doing here. Right now we're kicking off a bunch of agents
    to run in parallel. >> Dan A4 EC 608 built out your post tool used failure hook
    so error handling works smoothly now. A249 B56 built out the session end hook
    implementation and it's ready to go. >> All right, so you're hearing our sub agent
    text to speech responses. Those are going to keep streaming in here. So it might
    be >> agent A7A 26A nailed it. >> It might be a little annoying. It's going to
    interrupt us a bunch here, but every sub aent that completes is going to summarize
    their work as well. So I have this built into the sub agent stop hook >> a356.
    Got your setup hook implementation done. Hook setup.py PI file is ready and Dan
    A1FA9A7 built your permission and it's ready to handle authorization. >> Awesome.
    This work is just going to continue to stream in. The next important piece is
    of course agent orchestration. If we collapse everything here, you can see a classic
    agentic prompt format. We have our purpose. We have our list of variables. You
    can see our prompt format and our orchestration prompt. We have our instructions.
    This is where things get really interesting. Inside of the instructions, we have
    an additional new block, team orchestration. And so here we're starting to detail
    these new task management tools. Task create, update, list, and git. This is how
    the task system works. This is everything that our primary agent needs to conduct,
    control, and orchestrate all possible sub aents, right? The communication happens
    through this task list. This is a huge stepping stone from just calling ad hoc
    sub aents without a common mission without task dependencies and without a way
    to communicate to each agent that the work is or isn't done yet. We're detailing
    some things there. But what's really important here is in our workflow. If we
    look at our agentic prompt format here where we're detailing the steps that we
    want our plan with team prompt to set up, um we can see something really interesting
    here. In step four and five, we're doing two important things. We're defining
    team members using the orchestration prompt if provided and we're defining stepby-step
    tasks. So our plan is going to use team orchestration. So this primary agent that
    is actually creating this plan is going to build a team and then give each team
    member a task step by step. All right. So this is, you know, unique in that our
    previous planning prompts that we would set up that create the plans for us that
    research the codebase, we would have to specify exactly what agent was running,
    exactly how we wanted to specialize that workflow, and then it would run in some
    topto bottom format that you would have to strictly organize. Now, with teams
    and with the task list, we can teach our primary agent how to create plans that
    also contain individual team members. And then the last very important piece of
    this prompt is that we are templating. So this metaprompt is actually a template
    metaprompt. This is a big idea we talk about in tactical agentic coding. We're
    teaching our agents how to build as we would. You can see here we have a plan
    format and the plan format actually has embedded prompts inside of it. Replace
    nested content with the actual request inside of it. So our plan is going to come
    out to task name. And we can pull up the plan that was generated side by side
    here. If we open up specs, you can see we have hooks update with team. And if
    we go side by side, you can see exactly how this is getting templated. Here's
    the plan name. Here's the task description. And then we're having our agent fill
    out the task description. So this agent is really building as we would. You want
    to be teaching your agents how to build like you would, right? This is the big
    difference between a gentic engineering and vibe coding and slop engineering.
    When you're running a prompt to a random tool like Clawbot or insert whatever
    tool, whatever agent, and you don't know what the agent is actually going to do
    or how it's going to do the work, the results can be anywhere from exactly what
    you wanted to not so great to this doesn't work at all. As models progress and
    become more proficient, of course, you'll be able to prompt with less effort,
    with less thought. But if you're doing real engineering work, you want to be going
    the opposite direction. You want to know the outcome that your agent is generating
    for you. And you can do that with the template prompt, right? specifically the
    template meta prompt. This is a prompt that generates a new prompt in a very specific,
    highly vetted consistent format. And so we can just continue down the line. You
    can see the objective on both sides here, right? We have our problem statement.
    We have the solution approach. So on and so forth. But where things get interesting
    is here. We have team orchestration. If we search for this uh I know for a fact
    that team orchestration will be inside the generated prompt. Why is that? It's
    because if we scroll up here, remember that this stop hook ran self validation.
    And check this out, right? It's running validate file contains. It's making sure
    that it's in the specs directory, which obviously it is here. It's a markdown
    file and it contains these sub points. So, I'm making absolute sure that the file
    that was generated has the correct section. If it doesn't, this script here, validate
    file contains, is going to spit back out instructions for this planner agent.
    Right? So, this is very, very powerful. We're combining specialized self validation,
    which we've covered in a previous video, with this new team orchestration with
    powerful templating. Okay? And again, templating is something we discuss at length
    in tactical agent coding because it allows you to teach your agents to build like
    you would. But this team orchestration section is very, very powerful. So, let's
    go and just take a look at this. You can see here this is part of a template,
    but it's, you know, just raw text. So, our agent copied it as is per the instructions.
    But then here our agent starts building out the team members. And so, you know,
    to be super clear here, just to reiterate this, on the left we have the template
    metaprompt. And on the right, we have the generated plan file that our agent is
    running and probably has completed it by now. Okay, look, it's it's already finished,
    right? 2 minutes of work thanks to that parallel setup. Everything's already done.
    Hooks configured, complete documentation in the readme. We'll check this out after
    we finish breaking down this powerful prompt. Right. So, team members, you can
    see builder, validator, builder, validator, builder, validator, on and on and
    on. Right? I have two specific agents that I'm using in this workflow. And I think
    this is going to be the most like foundational like bare minimum that you're going
    to want to have set up. A builder and a validator. An agent that does the work
    and an agent that checks the work. I'm 2xing the compute for every single task
    so that we build and then we validate. We actually push this further. I'll show
    you the agents in just a second here, but uh you can see here in our prompt template,
    we have our builder and then we're specifying the name, role, agent type, and
    if it should resume if something goes wrong. And this is all just about filling
    in the variables, filling in the specification for the team that's going to execute
    this work. Okay, we also have the step-by-step tasks, which breaks down the actual
    workflow. This is the part of the plan where we're just going through step by
    step and our agents are going through the work that they need to do. And so this
    is this task list. Just to make this super clear, this is the task list that we're
    building up, working step by step. And again, we built this into a reusable prompt
    that we can deploy over and over and over. And so, you know, it's always one thing
    to just open up a terminal and start prompting something, but we can do much much
    better than this, right? Build reusable prompts, build reusable skills. I think
    a lot of engineers in the space, you already understand this as a kind of foundational
    concept, but you can push it further. Remember this metaprompt has three powerful
    components. It is self- validating. It is building a team and it has specific
    instructions on how to build a team. And if the orchestration prompt is provided
    like we passed in, that orchestration prompt is actually going to help guide how
    the planner builds the team. All right, so that's where you solve that. And then
    we're also templating. So this is a template metaprompt. It might sound like a
    super fancy term, but it's it's not. It's a prompt that generates another prompt
    in a specific format. All right, it's actually quite simple, but it's very very
    powerful. This is advanced agentic prompt engineering. But once you see this and
    once you start building these out, it becomes second nature. Becomes very easy
    to build out these reusable formulas for success in your engineering work. All
    right. And you can see what it's built out here for us. Uh a huge prompt. You
    know, we have all of our validation commands at the bottom as you saw here. We
    have notes here. You know, again, this is a classic metaprompt. The big difference
    here is that we are instructing our metaprompt that's going to run over and over
    and over for us hundreds of times. We're instructing it how to build a team with
    the new cloud code task system. And so what does the new cloud code task system
    look like? How is this unique? As mentioned, what we're doing here is we're actually
    building up a task list and a dedicated team to handle the individual tasks. Now,
    this is vastly superior to the previous generation to-do list and previous generation
    sub aent colon via the task tool because you can set up tasks that run in specific
    order that block and that depend on other tasks to be complete. Okay. And not
    only that, this allows for massively longer running threads of work because your
    primary agent can orchestrate a massive task list, kick it off, and then as agents
    complete it will receive specific events. As sub agents complete work, they will
    actually ping back to the primary agent that accomplished the work. And the primary
    agent can react to it in real time. So you don't have to sit, you don't need to
    add bash, sleep, loops. The task system handles all of that. And now, you know,
    speaking of the task system, what are the task system key function? So let's just
    take a look at the key ones, right? There's task create, there's task get, we
    have task list, and we have task update. Task update is obviously the big one.
    You'll create a task and then update the task with additional details. The powerful
    thing about this is that your primary agent and your sub agents can use these
    tools to communicate to each other. That's what's happening here with these four
    tools. Task update is going to be the big one because this allows the sub agents
    and the primary agent to communicate the work. And this unlocks powerful workflows
    like this. We can now set up multi- aent teams with even more than one primary
    agent. So, you know, same type of workflow, right? You kick off a larger plan,
    a larger set of work. Your agents will start working on it. The agents will then
    complete their work and then the blocked tasks are now unblocked and the agents
    will continue working through those piece by piece, sending messages that they
    finished once the task list is complete. And really, as work completes, the primary
    agents will be alerted. So, you can spin up as many agents as you want. And notice
    how this is looking a lot like the agent threads that we talked about a couple
    weeks ago. You know, thread-based engineering is a powerful mental framework to
    think about how work gets complete. And we're seeing that here with this multi-
    aent task system. So, just once again, you prompt your agents. Your agents create
    a large task list. Your agent teams, right? Your sub agents then accomplish the
    work in order reviewing, checking each other's work. If you set up the right reviewer
    agents, and then they unblock the next task, so on and so forth, right? They'll
    communicate when their work is done. The task list system will ping back to the
    agent and then your agent will respond to you once the work is done. So this is
    the powerful taskless system and it becomes even more powerful when you deploy
    it and build it into a reusable prompt that you can run over and over and over.
    So what did our agent do for us? It added and update the documentation for this
    codebase. Let's go ahead and check it out. Let's open up a terminal here. Let's
    run gs. So you can see all the files changed. You can see we have a bunch of new
    status lines. We got those new hooks that just weren't there. We updated the readme.
    We have that new spec. And we have our new JSON file. Let's go ahead and just
    diff this. And we can see those new hooks there. Session end, permission request,
    sub aent start, setup, and we have a bunch of new hooks. And every one of these
    hooks should have their own log file. So keep in mind if we open up this prompt
    here, let's just understand how these two agents work together. We had our planning
    agent build a team. Okay? And so why is this different? Why is this more powerful?
    because you can build specialized agents that do one thing extraordinarily well.
    All right. So, if we look at the team members here, uh where's that where's that
    note agent slash here we go. So, team members, this is a variable here and it's
    something that we detail inside of the workflow. In step four, we say this exactly,
    right? Use the orchestration prompt to guide team composition. Identify fromcloud
    agents team markdown. So we're looking at agents only in the specific directory
    or we're using a generalpurpose agent. And so if we open up this directory here.Cloud
    agents team, you can see I have just two teammates, right? Two specific types
    of agents that this codebase has access to. We have a builder and we have a validator.
    The purpose of the builder is just to focus on that one task to build it and then
    to report its work. But our builder goes a little further. We covered this in
    the previous video, but it's so important to keep mentioning this. You can now
    build specialized self validation into every one of your agents. You can see here
    my builder agent after it runs. So on post tool use, write edit, it's going to
    look to see if it's operating in a Python file and then it's going to run rough
    and ty. So it's going to run its own code checkers basically, right? And these
    can be any types of code validation that you want. The powerful thing here is
    that we've kind of built in a micro step of validation inside the builder on its
    own. And then we have a higher level validator agent that's just going to make
    sure that the task was done properly, right? Make sure that the code is complete,
    make sure that it can run whatever validation it needs to validate that the builder
    did actually do the work. Okay, so I really like this kind of two agent pairing.
    We're basically increasing our compute to increase the trust we have that the
    work was delivered. And if we had a specific type of validation, we could also
    build out tools to give this agent specialized tools to make sure that the builder
    did his job properly. I think this is probably the simplest team combination you
    can build. Of course, there are other things, you know, QA tester agents, reviewer
    agents, deploy agents, blog monitoring agents. You can build all types of agent
    teams, but I think these are the two most foundational. Have an agent build the
    thing and then have another agent validate the thing. Very powerful. This is what
    our primary agent that was doing the planning work, right, with the template metaprompt.
    This is what it used to actually put together the team. You know to be super clear
    if we search for team orchestration here we can see our team members but you can
    see here every one of these agents was unique. So we built a session end builder
    for this session end hook and then we built the corresponding validator. Same
    thing with permission request builder and then permission request validator. All
    right and this is where it gets really powerful. If we go to this step-by-step
    task, you can see here we have build workflows. So build build build. And then
    guess what happens after six? We have validators. is doing compilation on the
    code to make sure that it's legit. And then we have additional validation steps
    down here. And you know, looking back at this, I actually missed an opportunity
    here. If I search for claw-p, there's a huge opportunity for every validator agent
    to actually just fire off claw--pey all logs are created in logs slash. We could
    have built a more tighter closed loop where the agents were validating this log
    file. We have all of our logs for each one of these new methods. So, if we just
    search for one of our new ones, session end, we should see a session end file
    here now. Yeah, there's our session end. And so, we have some new logging files
    that just weren't there before, right? Permission request. Um, and one of the
    newer ones that I haven't really played with a lot, post tool use failure. And
    you can see that log file there. Fantastic. And then you can see here, step 15,
    step 16, we're going to update the readme. So, of course, you know, simple validation
    here. Just to quickly check this, we can open this. And then once again, we can
    just search for one of these tools that weren't previously documented, right?
    So, if I just search for post tool use, you can see all of our documentation got
    edited. And we can do this even faster if we just want to get the file path here.
    GDF, which is get diff, and then we can just see the overall diff there. We got
    a bunch of new status lines. We got our file references updated, yada yada yada.
    We have our new documentation for these hooks here. So, that's fantastic. We also
    got our GDF uh settings file got updated as well. And you can see new hooks were
    added. Nothing super novel there. This was a relatively simple task for Opus to
    handle, especially with it deployed across multiple agents, focusing on one specific
    task at a time. That's another huge value proposition of this system. Every one
    of your agents has a focused context window doing one thing extraordinarily well.
    This is something we talk about all the time in tactical agent coding. This is
    the lesson six tactic. If you're interested, check that out. Link in the description.
    But basically, the more agents you have with focus context windows doing one specific
    thing, the better. And this multi- aent task system is perfect for that. Your
    top level planner orchestrator agent writes the plan. You want to refresh the
    context after that, kick it off in a new agent to do the building that was inside
    of the plan. But once they do that, your multi- aent systems task list and the
    individual agent teams that you assign the work to, they kind of take care of
    it from there. And that leads us to the question when should you use this task
    system? So this is on by default if you write a large enough prompt claude code
    and opus it knows it has access to these tools that in itself is like fine. It's
    like you know a little bit more valuable but I think if you're really pushing
    and you're really scaling what you can do with agents you're going to want to
    build out a meta prompt like this. Okay. It's a prompt that builds a prompt. Specifically
    with agentic coding there are two primary constraints. Planning and reviewing.
    you're probably spending most of your time planning or reviewing if you're doing
    things right, if you're doing true agentic engineering. Now, this prompt, this
    new set of tools really helps us in the planning phase. We can build out specialized
    agents that are again self- validating. So, every one of them is checking their
    own work. This is super important. I'll link previous videos on the channel where
    we talk about building out these embedded hooks so that your agents are validating
    specific work that they're designed to do. But what you can do with your team
    members, your agents that are, you know, built for specific purposes, is really
    build in unique workflows where you think about the combination of running multiple
    agents together that outperform a single one. And that's why, you know, we do
    build, we do test, we do build, we do review. We have a documentation agent that
    is just all about documenting. That's another direction we can go with this. You
    can see here our validator is just reporting if the thing was built right. If
    it was, we report success. If it wasn't, we report failure. Okay, so a very powerful
    dedicated agent just for validating work. And as mentioned here, you know, I could
    have pushed uh this validation a bit further. We should have had cloud-p messages
    for every single validation agent. Instead, we just got Python compile of the
    individual scripts. This is probably enough for Opus, though. If we open up any
    one of these files, right, we had the logs generated, too. But it's going to basically
    mirror and copy the previous format from all of the other hook scripts that were
    running. And yeah, just at a glance, I can see that this is right. So, we got
    our sub agent announce. This all looks great. But you get the point, right? We
    could have improved our validation there. And this is where that orchestrator
    prompt becomes even more important. If we go to plan with team here, remember
    we pass in two prompts. What we wanted to build and then the actual orchestration
    prompt. And I can pull that out here. I just copy pasted that in. Had that set
    up beforehand. So, you can just kind of see exactly what this looks like, right?
    create groups of agents for each hook, one builder and one validator. All right,
    so this is our orchestration prompt. This is our highle prompt that gets boiled
    down into a low-level prompt thanks to our metaprompt. Then in the orchestrator
    prompt, we're actually helping our agent guide how to build the team that does
    the work. This is a new paradigm of multi- aent orchestration that's emerging.
    This is one way you can use it repeatedly, consistently, and reliably. And it
    also gives you a little bit of flexibility because you can also pass in that orchestration
    prompt. So a couple big ideas we're hitting on here. Self- validation. We're hitting
    on multi- aent orchestration. And again, we're building it into our reusable prompts.
    A lot of engineers are going to miss this. Please don't be one of them. You can
    build team orchestration into your reusable prompt so you get the value every
    single time. Right? It only takes one time to build out a great prompt, right?
    Just that upfront investment is really where you want to be spending more and
    more of your time. As mentioned in tactical agentic coding, you want to be building
    the agentic layer of your code base. Don't work on the application anymore. Work
    on the agents that build the application for you. All right, big big idea there.
    Uh there's a lot of value embedded in that. A lot of what we're seeing coming
    out, you know, the Ralph Wickham technique, uh all of this stuff around multi-
    aent orchestration, which the cloud code team is not documenting very well. Oh,
    I wish they would really up their documentation on this stuff. This task feature
    is pushing in the direction of multi- aent orchestration. Remember, in the beginning,
    you have a base agent. Then you learn how to use it better by context engineering
    and prompt engineering. And then you add more agents. Very powerful. After you
    add more agents, you customize them. And then lastly, you add an orchestrator
    agent to help you conduct all of them. And that's what we're turning our primary
    agent into. Let's be super clear about this. your primary agent when they're working
    with this task list, when they're working with your agent teams, they are orchestrating.
    All right. Now, there's levels to this. We built our own multi- aent orchestration
    system inside of Agentic Horizon. Um, I'll link the course in the description
    obviously for you if you want to push what you can do with Agentic Engineering
    further beyond. I'll leave this prompt in the cloud code hooks mastery codebase
    for you. If you want to check it out, if you want to understand how you can build
    template meta prompts that encode your engineering, this is very, very powerful.
    I think there's a lot of hype right now in the tech industry. There's a lot of
    slop engineering and just vibe slopping and it's coming out by a lot of people
    just jumping onto these super super highle abstract tools like Moltbot. Now I
    have nothing against this thing. I can see why people are really interested. You
    know, it's very powerful. This thing's gone super viral, but I am super concerned
    about an over reliance on tools like this without understanding the pieces of
    it. Now I think if you're a agentic engineer, if you're an engineer that has been
    learning to really use agents and build proficient systems that operate with and
    without you, you know, go crazy with tools like this. You know what's happening
    underneath the hood. It's more of everyone else that I'm worried about, right?
    That uh really have no idea what's going on underneath the hood. When really,
    if you're trying to learn how to build with agents, it's all about the core four
    context, model, prompt, and tools. And it's about learning to leverage these fundamental
    levers of agentic coding, the fundamental pieces of building with agents. And
    that comes down to reusable prompts, building out your own specialized agents,
    and building out AI developer workflows, ADWs as we call them in TAC. It's all
    about knowing what you're doing and teaching your agents how to do it. All right.
    There's going to be a big gap between engineers that turn their brain off and
    engineers that keep learning and keep adding to their stack of agentics, their
    patterns and tools that they can use to teach their agents how to build on their
    behalf. I'm not saying don't use agents. I think this tool and other tools like
    it, they're incredible. What I'm saying is know how to use the primitives and
    the leverage points of agentic coding, right? The foundational pieces that make
    it all up. Because if you do that as I have, as many of us have that watch this
    channel, um you'll be able to hop from tool to tool to tool to feature to feature
    to feature. All right? And this tool is a great example, right? This system that
    the cloud code team has built out, it's not new, right? Open source tools have
    had this, but what they've done here is standardized it and made it accessible
    through the best agent coding tool. That's worth paying attention to. That's worth
    learning. These are just tools and prompts. This entire feature set is just tools
    and prompts. So if we needed to, if you wanted to, we could step away from cloud
    code. We could build it into another tool if needed. Thankfully, we don't have
    to. They built it in. This is the Claude Code task system. You can use this to
    build specialized agent teams when you combine it with a powerful meta prompt,
    a prompt that builds a prompt. And when you template and add self validation into
    your agentic systems, all right, these are powerful trends. We're starting to
    stack up on the channel. Make sure to like and comment. let the algorithm know
    you're interested in like real hands-on agentic engineering. I want to kind of
    push back against some of this, you know, insane AI hype that's going on right
    now. Let's stay close to the fundamentals. Let's stay close to what makes up the
    agent at a foundational level while increasing what we can do with this. All right,
    that's all for this one. You know where to find me every single Monday. Stay focused
    and keep building.

    text: you can do with agents in a cloud code
  - start: 00:00:51
    text: instance. We will slash plan, but this
  - start: 00:00:53
    text: isn't an ordinary plan. We're going to
  - start: 00:00:55
    text: plan with a team. We have a user prompt
  - start: 00:00:57
    text: and an orchestrator prompt. I'm going to

    text: and more compute doesn't always mean

    text: better outcomes. What we want is more
  - start: 00:01:19
    text: organized agents that can communicate
  - start: 00:01:21
    text: together to work toward a common goal.
  - start: 00:01:24
    text: If you want to understand how to use the

    text: cloud code task system at scale reliably
  - start: 00:01:28
    text: and consistently to create teams of
  - start: 00:01:30
    text: agents, stick around and let's jump
  - start: 00:01:33
    text: right in. Let's take a look at plan with
  - start: 00:01:35
    text: team. This isn't like most prompts
  - start: 00:01:38
    text: you've seen. This prompt has three
  - start: 00:01:40
    text: powerful components to it. Self-
  - start: 00:01:42
    text: validation, agent orchestration, and
  - start: 00:01:44
    text: templating. The first thing you'll
  - start: 00:01:46
    text: notice here is that we have hooks in the
  - start: 00:01:47
    text: front matter. This agent is self
  - start: 00:01:50
    text: validating. In fact, it has specialized
  - start: 00:01:52
    text: scripts that it uses to validate its own
  - start: 00:01:54
    text: work. You can see here we have validate
  - start: 00:01:56
    text: new file and we have validate file
  - start: 00:01:59
    text: contains. So on the stop hook once this
  - start: 00:02:02
    text: agent finishes running, it's going to
  - start: 00:02:04
    text: make sure that it created a file of a
  - start: 00:02:06
    text: specific type in a specific directory
  - start: 00:02:08
    text: and it's going to make sure that it
  - start: 00:02:09
    text: contains specific content. This is very
  - start: 00:02:13
    text: powerful. Now we know for a fact that
  - start: 00:02:15
    text: this plan was created. And in fact, we
  - start: 00:02:18
    text: should be able to see that right now. If
  - start: 00:02:19
    text: we close this, we can see that our plan
  - start: 00:02:21
    text: has been created and it's been
  - start: 00:02:23
    text: validated. And so now the next step is
  - start: 00:02:25
    text: we're going to actually kick this off.
  - start: 00:02:26
    text: And you can see our agent has done
  - start: 00:02:28
    text: something really interesting here. We
  - start: 00:02:30
    text: have a team task list. Every task has an
  - start: 00:02:34
    text: owner. All right. So this is not an
  - start: 00:02:35
    text: ordinary sub aent prompt. This task list
  - start: 00:02:38
    text: has specific team members doing specific
  - start: 00:02:41
    text: work all the way through. and we're
  - start: 00:02:43
    text: using two specific types of agents.
  - start: 00:02:45
    text: We're going to break down in just a
  - start: 00:02:46
    text: second a builder agent and a validator
  - start: 00:02:48
    text: agent. We're going to go ahead and kick
  - start: 00:02:50
    text: off this prompt and we're going to
  - start: 00:02:51
    text: actually start building this out. We'll
  - start: 00:02:53
    text: look at the spec. This is the second
  - start: 00:02:54
    text: prompt that we're going to look at and
  - start: 00:02:55
    text: we're going to understand why this
  - start: 00:02:58
    text: generated prompt from our meta prompt is
  - start: 00:03:00
    text: so unique. Let's just go ahead and kick
  - start: 00:03:02
    text: this off. Get this building in the
  - start: 00:03:03
    text: background. We're going to use a /bu
  - start: 00:03:04
    text: prompt. And now you'll notice here it is
  - start: 00:03:07
    text: building up that brand new task list.
  - start: 00:03:09
    text: And so it's just going to keep stacking
  - start: 00:03:11
    text: on the brand new task list. We're also
  - start: 00:03:13
    text: going to look at the actual tools that
  - start: 00:03:15
    text: this agent is running to put together
  - start: 00:03:17
    text: this team of agent and to communicate
  - start: 00:03:19
    text: the results. You can see we have five
  - start: 00:03:21
    text: more pending. So a lot of work is
  - start: 00:03:23
    text: getting stacked up here. And now we're
  - start: 00:03:25
    text: getting the dependency blockers. Not
  - start: 00:03:27
    text: only is our agent planning out work,
  - start: 00:03:29
    text: building a team, it's also setting up
  - start: 00:03:30
    text: the tasks and the order that the tasks
