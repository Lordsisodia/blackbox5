    Google’s AntiGravity is not just another AI IDE — it’s an agent-first automation\
    \ platform powered by Gemini 3. In this video, I show you how to use AntiGravity\
    \ the right way by going beyond basic prompts and tapping into its most powerful\
    \ features: Agent Manager, Plans, Artifacts, and real end-to-end automation.\n\

    \n\U0001F4CC LINKS & RESOURCES\nWebsite: https://antigravity.google/\n\nMost people\
    \ treat AntiGravity like a chat box with tools. That’s why it feels average. In\
    \ this breakdown, you’ll see how to structure agents properly, pass real context\
    \ across steps, and generate actionable outputs like CSVs, Google Sheets, and\
    \ Markdown artifacts — all without leaving the IDE.\n\nWe’ll walk through real\
    \ examples, including website audits, automation workflows, and how AntiGravity\
    \ coordinates multiple agents to finish tasks instead of stopping at text. If\
    \ you want to understand why AntiGravity is one of the most powerful free AI developer\
    \ tools available today, this is the video.\n\nWhat you’ll learn:\nWhy most people\
    \ use AntiGravity incorrectly\nHow the Agent Manager actually works\nUsing Plans\
    \ to orchestrate multi-step workflows\nArtifacts as a shared source of truth\n\
    Generating CSVs, dashboards, and structured outputs\nWhy AntiGravity is more than\
    \ a traditional IDE\nIf you’re building with AI, this is how you stay ahead. \U0001F680\
