    \ https://antigravity.google/download\n\nWith Pencil, developers and designers\
    \ can build UI designs and layout screens visually without leaving their coding\
    \ environment — no more jumping between Figma and code. The best part? Your designs\
    \ and code live together in your repository, generating real production-ready\
    \ code like HTML, CSS, or React, while keeping you fully in control.\n\nIn this\
    \ video, I show a live demo of how Pencil turns Figma designs into code effortlessly.\
    \ Copy in Figma, paste in Pencil, and see styles, layout, and pixel-perfect accuracy\
    \ preserved — all powered by AI agents working alongside you. Pencil even allows\
    \ multi-agent collaboration, letting multiple AI agents generate parts of your\
    \ UI or entire screens simultaneously.\n\nIf you’re a developer, designer, or\
    \ AI enthusiast, this tool is a total game-changer for AI-native design workflows.\
    \ Watch now and see why Pencil.dev is taking design and coding to the next level!\n\
