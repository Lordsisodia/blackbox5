  title: Stop Adding Tools. Save Code as Skills
  description: 'Original video: https://youtu.be/tTZ4yDY4adg


    About:

    This video explains what skills actually are in the context of AI agents. Instead
    of relying on a large set of hardcoded tools, the agent was given a single open-ended
    code execution tool and allowed to discover a working solution on its own. Once
    a layout strategy was found through iteration, the working code was saved as a
    skill and reused across future runs. This approach reduces token usage, improves
    consistency, and allows agents to build from proven solutions instead of reinventing
    workflows from scratch.'
