  title: Save Code Once, Reuse It as a Skill

    About:

    This video explains what skills are in the context of AI agents. Skills are reusable,
    on-demand instructions and scripts that show an agent how to execute a specific
    workflow efficiently. Instead of relying on many predefined tools, the agent uses
    a single open-ended code execution tool and reusable skills that contain real
    working code. This allows the agent to explore, iterate, and debug freely, then
    save successful solutions as skills and reuse them in future runs, reducing token
    usage and avoiding starting from scratch every time.'
