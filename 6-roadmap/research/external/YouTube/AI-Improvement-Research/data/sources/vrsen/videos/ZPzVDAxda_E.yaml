  title: 'GPT-5.2 vs 5.1 Agents: Real Work Test'
  description: "\U0001F468‍\U0001F4BB If you're a developer / agency and want to build\
    \ your own AI solutions, join our FREE Skool community. You'll find support on\
    \ every step of the way: https://www.skool.com/agency-ai\n\n\U0001F680 Try out\
    \ our platform when you’re ready to deploy your agents to production: https://agencii.ai\
    \ \n\n*Timestamp:*\n00:00 - Intro\n00:32 - Why GPT-5.2 Matters for Agents\n03:54\
    \ - Building 3 Agents\n08:37 - Let Agents Run Code\n12:10 - Which Model Should\
    \ You Use?\n\n*About:*\nIn this video, I run a real head-to-head test between\
    \ GPT-5.2 and GPT-5.1 to see which model actually performs better for professional\
    \ knowledge work and AI agents. Instead of benchmarks in isolation, we build and\
    \ evaluate real agents side by side to understand where GPT-5.2 delivers meaningful\
    \ gains and where it is just more expensive.\n\n*You’ll see how I:*\n- Build three\
    \ real production agents for spreadsheets, presentations, and coding\n- Compare\
    \ GPT-5.2 vs GPT-5.1 using the exact same prompts, tools, and workflows\n- Break\
    \ down the GPT-5.2 announcement and isolate the benchmarks that actually matter\
    \ for agents\n- Test long-context reasoning, tool calling, and multi-agent orchestration\
    \ in practice\n- Let agents execute real code to generate CSVs, dashboards, and\
    \ PowerPoint decks\n- Evaluate output quality, structure, reliability, and iteration\
    \ speed across models\n- Analyze pricing trade-offs and explain when GPT-5.2 is\
    \ worth the cost (and when it is not)\n\nIf you’re building production AI agents,\
    \ internal tools, or knowledge-work automation and want to understand whether\
    \ GPT-5.2 is a real upgrade over GPT-5.1, this video walks through the full process,\
    \ real results, and practical decision criteria you can apply immediately."
