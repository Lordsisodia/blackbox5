    About: In this video, I''ll show you how to create 100% AI-generated UGC ads using
    an autonomous AI agent system. We''re talking about everything from market research
    to scripting to final video generation - all done by AI agents working together.
    What makes this different from other UGC tools is that it''s trained on a real
    e-comm agency process that already made over $2.5 million with Sora ads. Unlike
    simple automations that just spit out a video, this agent lets you iterate and
    refine results based on your feedback, just like working with a real video editor.
    I''ll walk you through the complete setup in about 60 seconds, show you how it
    works with a live demo, and break down how we trained this multi-agent system
    so you can customize or fork it for your own niche. If you''re looking to resell
    AI solutions to clients or build your own vertical agents, make sure to watch
    until the end.'
