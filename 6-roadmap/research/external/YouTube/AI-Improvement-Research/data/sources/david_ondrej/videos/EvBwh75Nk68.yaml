transcript:
  full_text: If I were to structure the Bible, I would probably start it with the
    book of Proverbs. I'm not really religious, but the book of Proverbs has to be
    one of the greatest books I've ever read. It's really short. It's I don't know
    30 40 pages, but the amount of wisdom in those pages is truly incredible. And
    also the breadth of topics, just how many different aspects of lives that it covers.
    It's amazing. So, if you're not religious, but you're seeking ancient wisdom that
    is more relevant today than you think, read the book of Proverbs.
