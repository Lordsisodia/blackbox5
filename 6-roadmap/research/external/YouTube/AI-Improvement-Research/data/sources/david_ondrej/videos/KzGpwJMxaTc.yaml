  full_text: What is the best AI business model of 2026? This is a question I get
    asked infinitely and the answer is simple. It's something that improves [music]
    as AI models get better. Right? So if your business isn't improving when another
    GPT version releases or another version of cloud releases, you're going to get
    crushed because sooner or later some other software or some other business will
    be able to do what you're [music] doing way faster, way cheaper and to higher
    quality or the models themselves are able to going to do it [music] because GIGBT
    is becoming more of an AI agent. Same with Gemini, same with cloth. And as the
    models get better, they are able to do more different tasks.
