transcript:
  full_text: Deepseek and Kimmy are just as good as Chpd, but there's a catch. To
    run them locally, you need expensive GPUs. We're talking thousands of dollars
    in hardware, or you'll get stuck paying for multiple subscriptions across different
    platforms. But I found a way to access over 30 different opensource models without
    any of that. It's called Okara and it gives you DeepSeek, Kim, Quen, Llama, Mistrol,
    all in a single place. No GPUs required. No more juggling multiple subscriptions.
    You can even switch between multiple models mid conversation without losing context.
    Oh, and unlike CIGBT, every chat is encrypted and is never used to train models.
    So, if you want access to the best open source AI models without breaking the
    bank, go to okara.ai. The eye.
