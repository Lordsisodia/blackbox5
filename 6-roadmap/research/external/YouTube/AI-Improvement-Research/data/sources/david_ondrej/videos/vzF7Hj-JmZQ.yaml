  full_text: Here is how you can get 100 paying customers from Reddit with zero marketing
    budget. Most people think that Reddit marketing is spammy or that it doesn't work.
    But that's because you're doing it wrong. I found an AI tool that monitors Reddit
    24/7, finds highv value conversations related to your product, and helps you write
    real authentic comments that actually convert. Here's the process. Go to okara.ai/reddit.
    Select the Reddit agent. Tell it the keywords you want to track. So, let's say
    you're building a Chad GBD alternative. Just type in chat GPT alternative. The
    agent then finds highly relevant Reddit threads where people are already searching
    for this and then it writes helpful comments that you can instantly post. So all
    you need to do is just copy the comment and post it. If you want to try this yourself,
    go to okara.ai/reddit.dit.dit.dit.dit.dit.dit.
