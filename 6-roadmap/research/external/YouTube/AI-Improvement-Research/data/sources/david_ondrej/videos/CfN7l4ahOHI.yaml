  full_text: If you're in business, you're always in business. Things are always happening.
    It doesn't matter if you're in your office or if you're on a ski slope. So, if
    you're trying to build an AI startup, just be prepared for constant problem solving.
    And just don't take it personally because, you know, I had a call with my main
    dev and his side project just raised $2 million, which means that in about a month,
    I'm going to be like losing my main developer. And yeah, it's just a normal day
    in business, you know, but you cannot take these things personally. You have to
    adapt to them and make decisions on the move. If I was a beginner entrepreneur,
    I would probably get a headache from this, but I literally don't care. It is what
    it is. Obviously, it's it's unlucky losing such a good developer, but then again,
    his project raised 2 million, so I cannot really match that with a salary.
