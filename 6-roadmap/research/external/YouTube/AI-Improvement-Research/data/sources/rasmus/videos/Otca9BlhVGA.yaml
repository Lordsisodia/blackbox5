  full_text: It seems like every single day on Twitter, I see someone making money
    with a mobile app. And I ask myself, how are they building it? How are they marketing
    it? How is this whole machine working? Cuz some people just seem to be pumping
    these things [music] out like hotcakes. I did the research. I found the answers.
    I myself have started doing this as well, and I'm going to be sharing with you
    the insider sauce in today's video. So, sit back, relax, get your popcorn. Let's
    get into it. Honestly, the formula is pretty simple. When it comes to building
    mobile apps, [music] we just need to build it. We need to market it. And the combination
    of these two hopefully leads to some money. Now, first thing, let's talk about
    building a mobile app. I [music] think mobile is a lot more difficult compared
    to web in a sense where the web ecosystem is so rich and the web is so open, right?
    You literally deploy your site and it's available for everyone. But with mobile,
    you have two places you care about. iOS and Android. Now, I'm going to be honest.
    If you're building an app and your focus is maximizing money, you can kind of
    throw Android out the window. I know, I know everybody loves Android. All of you
    guys love Android. But the truth of the matter is most paying people, most paying
    customers, people who are willing to pay for apps use iOSes use iPhone. Now, that
    may say something about people who own iPhones, but at the end of the day, we're
    here to maximize shareholder value. And in order to do that, I would say the biggest
    focus for your mobile app should be iOS. Now, what tech stack should you use?
    I know again we always talk about tech stack on this channel, but what tech stack
    would I use? I'm using React Native because React Native allows me to build for
    both. Even though, yes, I told you to focus on iOS. What I mean is the experience,
    the look, the feel. [music] You should 100% optimize for iOS. Now, there's going
    to be someone in the comments saying, "Oh, what about Android users?" Yes, you
    could do that, too. But I'm assuming we're we're thinking about moving really
    fast so we can go to market really quickly. I would focus on iOS. So React Native
    and then I would use Expo. This is going to help me build the app, deploy the
    app, and all that other nonsense. I'll be honest, Expo is a lifesaver because
    Apple is really hard to deal with all the build steps and the certificates and
    all that stuff. Expo really makes it easy. If you want to deploy your app, all
    you have to do is run this command and then you just follow the steps, right?
    So React Native is what I'm using to build the app. Expo is what I'm using it
    to package it and deploy it. You can think of Expo like Nex.js. Honestly, they
    have their own router as well. It's pretty awesome. Now for the back end, I'm
    using Convex. And the reason why I'm using Convex is mobile apps. The experiences
    have to be good. They have to feel fluid. They got to feel fast. And in order
    to achieve this, you're going to need a supercharged backend in a real-time database.
    Now for Oth, you can use whatever you want to use. Clerk, work OS, you want to
    use better off. Make your pick, right? Whatever is easiest for you to ship with
    and move with. This is what I'd use to build an app. Now, recently I saw this
    tweet that said, "Genzie's putting themselves in timeout and calling it healing.
    No phone, no TV, no music, no food, just silence. They're calling it raw dogging
    boredom. 15 minutes of sitting completely zero distractions. You get the gist,
    right? So, I saw this tweet [music] and then what I decided to do is like, oh,
    I'm just going to quickly build an app that allows you to do this." So, you can
    see the app here. It's called Timeout. I have O set up and for O I just used Clerk
    just to get started quickly. So you see me I'm creating an account. Uh I'm [music]
    just going to click continue here and then literally all like I have a mini onboarding
    explaining what the timeout up does. Click start timeout. I begin and then it
    does 15 minutes, right? That's what the trend is about. So, I have the timeout
    going and I built this feature where like let's say I go to Twitter because I
    have issues and I can't focus. And if I go back to the app, it tells me you peaked.
    Try again. I can then click on history and I can see my streaks. So far, I haven't
    completed a 15-minute timeout session. Right? So, the reason why I bring this
    up is [music] when you're building your app, it's very important to sort of be
    locked in with the trends, right? And this sort of goes into marketing. [music]
    In order to build a successful BTOC app, your marketing has to be on point. And
    this is the one place you're going to focus. I know most of you are going to hate
    this, but Tik Tok, ladies and gents, [music] is where it's at. Tik Tok is so influential
    and so powerful. I knew it was powerful because my wife uses it as a search engine.
    She wants to find out if a place is good or she's looking for a specific product.
    She's not going to Google like us devs or [music] Chad GBT or Perplexity or whatever
    you nerds are using nowadays. They're going on Tik Tok. Gents, ladies, [music]
    the people, the normies are going on Tik Tok. So, when you're building your app,
    if you don't have any ideas, might I suggest doom scrolling on Tik Tok a little
    bit and calling it research? Now, here's the funny part. For most of us, the building
    isn't actually the difficult part. It's the marketing. So, what how do I go about
    marketing my app? First things first is I would download Tik Tok and sort of see
    what's going on, what's trending. But here is the secret sauce. If you're not
    a Tik Tok user, if you're not into brain rock content, if you don't understand
    internet culture, find someone who does, right? There's no point in you downloading
    Tik Tok and you're confused and you don't know what's going on and you don't even
    know what Cap Cut is. If you don't know, if you're not trying to learn, I would
    highly suggest you work with somebody who does. For example, I don't know if you
    guys have ever noticed, I never really promoted it, but I run a product studio
    called Fabrica. And this product studio, we build people's [music] products, whether
    it be AI products, web, mobile apps, every vertical, we've [music] built it. And
    you know, praise the Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord. It's been pretty successful.
    We've had a great year. [music] And guess what? When it started, I was by myself.
    I then partnered with my friend Muso. Reason being is there were things he was
    good at that I didn't want to do and there were things I was good at that he didn't
    want to do right he's great with logistics business sales now I could do those
    things I rather not I rather be focused on the tech and building things so him
    and I have complimenting skills and because two heads are better than one the
    product studio started to grow now we have a full-time developer we have a full-time
    editor hi Ken >> okay >> and the reason why I'm sharing this with you is if this
    is not you if creating content if recording videos If all this stuff is not you,
    if Tik Tok is not you, I'm sure you have a cousin who's deranged [music] and all
    he or she does is scroll on Tik Tok. This is their time to shine. Partner up with
    them, work with them. You build, they create content. Now, I can already hear
    some of you nerds saying, "Why not web apps? Why does it have to be mobile? I
    can just push to Verscell and deploy a web app pretty quickly." Cuz most of the
    normies don't care for web apps. It's just true. They're on Tik Tok. They see
    uh some UGC video of someone using an app. They see the app. They go on the app
    store. They download the app and they use it. That's what the normies are doing.
    Again, if you're building a B2B SAS, yes, stick to the web. Watch the other videos.
    But this is for my people looking to build mobile apps that people are going to
    use. Now, while I was in SF, I met two awesome guys who are the founder of this
    app called Kandle. They're both Convex customers. Kendall [music] is built using
    Convex. Parth and Alex. and their app Candle, if I'm not mistaken, has hundreds
    of thousands of users [music] and they're doing insane levels of monthly recurring
    revenue. And this is their strategy. It's three people, three or four people max.
    They obviously build an awesome app. If I'm not mistaken, their tech stack is
    React Native, Expo, and Convex. And when I was speaking with them, they told me
    every single day, one person from the team has to create a Tik Tok video. And
    ladies and gents, that's their strategy. Now, mind you, these guys are very creative.
    They're very smart. They're good at creating content. They created the right app,
    the right demographic. They hit a lot of these key points. Now, how do we get
    to that point? You get to that point by just shooting. You just get to that point
    by throwing as many threes from the three-point line. And at some point, one of
    them's going to hit. At some point, you're going to start learning from your failures.
    And [music] failed experience becomes experience that leads to success. I'm not
    going to lie, that was a quotable. But I say that to say it would be very wise
    to build a very simple template for yourself. Make a simple text stack that allows
    you to ship. Deploy a couple of apps. Get one of your brain rock cousins or siblings
    to record Tik Tok videos. And this, ladies and gents, is your million-doll operation.
    And this is what we started to do at my product studio. We're starting to build
    our own apps. We have one called Altoia that's launching soon. It's a travel app.
    And literally, this is our formula. We build the app. [music] We market the app
    on socials, Tik Tok, Instagram. We keep doing both until the checks start flying.
    Again, my boy Jack, look at this tweet. [music] He's hit 5K already with his app.
    And this is the strat. He built an app for couples, right? And [music] there's
    something about picking the right niche that also matters. I've noticed that the
    couple niche is booming right now. Everybody's making apps for couples. And Jack
    did that. And I think in like what 15 days [music] he said he hit 5K MR. nothing
    special. He has a tech stack that he uses. He [music] uses Tik Tok and Instagram
    to create content. It does help that yes, he is [music] uh an influencer on Twitter,
    right? 61K followers. But I'm telling you this, Twitter is not the demographic
    you want to focus on. Most of the people that are following you, that are following
    me, are devs. They're going to see your app and be like, "Duh, I can build this."
    And that's true. I can build the app that he's selling as well. But really what's
    helping him scale his app and what's going to take him even further is when [music]
    he starts crushing it on Tik Tok and Instagram. Now some of you might say we are
    adding to the Brain Rod economy. We are creating Brain Rod apps [music] and the
    type of app you create is completely up to you. I want to encourage you to create
    apps of value. Uh but also, you know, you got to gamify it. You got to see the
    trends. You got to know what's going on. I don't know about you, but at the end
    of the day, shoot or shoot. I've given you the formula. Use this video as inspiration
    to get in and start [music] building some apps. Start partnering with people.
    Start shipping. Don't just watch people do it. You do it yourself. I hope you
    enjoyed this video. Make sure to like, comment, subscribe, hit the notification
    bell. I'll see you in the next one. [music] and peace.
