  full_text: I built an AI voice agent that can scam your grandmother. But because
    I fear God, we're going to prank call my friend instead. In this video, I'm going
    to give you a demo of the voice AI agent platform that I'm building. I'm also
    going to share with you some code, a backend. I'm literally going to give you
    an express server that you can deploy. I'm going to show you how to deploy it.
    And you can spin up your own AI voice agents. You can even give them phone numbers
    and people can call them and interact with them. This video is going to be fun.
    It's going to be simple. Sit back, relax. Let's get into it. So, first things
    first, let's look at this voice agent platform that I'm building. It's for businesses,
    but in this case, we're going to use it to prank call my friend. So, I'm going
    to create a new business. We're going to call this Prank Call Central. Uh, we're
    going to leave the description blank. We don't have to add a knowledge base, but
    I have it in such a way where, like, if you're a business, you can add all your
    knowledge base. And this will be the voice agent will have access to all this
    information. So, we're just going to skip for now. Phone number, we're going to
    call this the mainline. Area code 207. We're going to buy the number and I'm going
    to show you the platform we're using to build all this stuff. Now, we're going
    to configure the agent. We're going to call it prank call agent and it says you're
    a prank call agent. I don't want it to be a helpful voiceful assistant. You are
    going to be rude and disrespectful to the person that you call. Make fun of their
    forehead and tell them to lock in. I think this is a a great um this is a great
    start. I don't want the first message to be hello, how can I help you? The first
    message to be what's up bro. Super disrespectful. All right, we're going to have
    open AI GBT40. I will just have it be the default voice and then we'll have my
    number be the transfer number and we're going to click create assistant. So the
    assistant has been created. I'm going to go to go to dashboard. So now I see my
    phone number is being activated. It's going to take a minute for it to activate.
    While that's the case, I'm going to show you the platform that I'm using. The
    platform that I'm using to build the AI agents, the voice AI agents, is Vappy.
    And Vapy is an excellent platform with an even better API. Not only can you build
    agents, you can give these agents tools. You can create squads, which is like
    multiple agents. You can give them knowledge bases. Like there's so much you can
    do. Like Vappy is actually an excellent platform if you're trying to build anything
    voice related. So basically the app I've built wraps around Vappy all the services
    and it presents it in a nice beautiful user experience for business owners. Now
    I can see I have no knowledge base but I can see the assistants that have been
    created. I can click on the prank call assistant. I see some information here.
    I see the system prompt here. I would get the call history. There are no calls
    here. I can like make changes to the AI agent if I want to. And here I can attach
    a number to this agent. So when someone calls this number, the agent's going to
    answer or the agent's going to when the agent calls somebody, this is the number
    they're going to use. And they can also, if someone requests a transfer, they
    can transfer the call to my number. So I'm going to just select the phone number
    that we created. The phone number has been assigned now. So now what I'm going
    to do is I'm going to get the agent to call my best friend. And here's hoping
    he answers. Okay. So I've entered my friend's number and we're going to click
    start call. And hopefully in a couple of minutes. Okay, so it says call started.
    So hopefully in a couple minutes we either get So it says cute. So the call is
    happening. Hopefully in a couple minutes we either get some call history where
    the calls are recorded by the way. So we can listen to the recording or I get
    a transfer call from my homie saying, "Ahah, that was funny." I I think he'll
    know it's me cuz I told him I was working on this. Okay, so the call ended. I
    think Momi answered so we could see the call details. It says the call was brief
    informal exchange where the AI repeatedly teased the user about their satellites
    sized forehead comparing it to a lander landing strip. The user's response were
    minimal and the call ended with the customer hanging up. What's up little bro?
    What's good bro? How you doing? Okay, let's just listen to this. Let's just listen
    to this. >> What's bro? >> What's good, bro? How you doing? I'm good. But the
    real question is, are you good uh with that satellite sized forehead of yours?
    You better lock in and check the weather report for [laughter] that thing. [laughter]
    >> He gets it. He knows it's me. >> Open. You mean your forehead? Cuz that thing
    is wide open [laughter] like a landing strip. Make sure to lock in before you
    catch a breeze. [laughter] make you. >> So, it worked. It worked. This is really
    fun. It worked. Shout out to my boy Joseph. Uh, appreciate you for being a good
    sport. But, it worked. You see the voice agent, the platform works. Now, what
    I'm going to do is in the description, you're going to find this repo. It's an
    express server, super lightweight that you can run yourself, and you can create
    these agents. They're called assistants and you can attach phone numbers to them
    and you can call these assistants agents, give them whatever crazy system prompt
    you want and you can talk to them. It's actually so fun. So, I have the code downloaded,
    right? Again, it's an express server. Uh, for DB, I'm just using a simple JSON
    file. Nothing too crazy. I want to give you this API so you can play with it and
    build your own voice agents. We're going to start with the /ass assistance route,
    particularly the post request. This is where we create an assistant. So, we're
    going to get um the name of the assistant, the first message we want to send in,
    and the system prompt. Basically, these things don't exist. We're going to error
    out. And then this is how clean the Vappy API is. I call Vappy Assistant.create.
    I pass a name, first message, the model configuration. I'm going to use OpenAI
    chat GBT40. And then I pass in a system prompt. And basically, the system prompt
    is you're a real human professional personal assistant. Never call yourself an
    AI. Blah blah blah blah blah. You can have it however you want, right? And then
    I picked a voice uh provider from 11 Labs. This is the voice ID. And basically
    where you can select um voices is you can click on voice library on Vappy and
    you can just pick whatever one. I just picked the one that sounded cool to me,
    right? And then once this runs, an assistant is created. I basically store that
    in the DB, right? And I return that. So if I go to where's the JSON? This is these
    are two assistants I created and this is one phone number I created. And for phone
    number, basically the way the phone number endpoint works is I'm going to go to
    post request again and and basically all I do is vap.s.create. I pass in the provider
    that you can use Twilio or other phone providers. I hardcode the area code because
    207 is the one Vappy has available for free. And then basically I store that phone
    number in the DB. And then what I do is I have this patch endpoint where basically
    I can make updates to the agent. But in particular one thing that I would update
    is the phone number. Right? So right here I see you see if phone number is provided
    then I basically I get that phone number and then I make an update to the agent.
    Right? I attach the phone number to the agent and obviously I update the DB as
    well. Now if I call that number the agent is going to respond. And again I have
    a get request where I can get all uh agents a post request to create patch to
    update delete to delete the agent. Same thing with the phone numbers endpoint.
    And then I can also get like specific phone numbers by passing the ID. Right?
    And all I have in vap.ts is I'm initializing the vap client and I pass in a vapi
    key. All of this is found in the dashboard. You click on API keys and get you
    an API key. Now, I want to deploy this Express server. And what I'm going to be
    using to deploy it is I'm going to be using fly.io. We're going to click on launch
    app, right? I have a 7-day free trial. And what I want to do is I want to launch
    from my machine. So, I've already run this installation command, this brew install
    command. Now, I'm just going to type fly launch in my terminal. So, let's do fly
    launch. It's going to say, would you like to use the flytoml configuration for
    this app? I already have one created. This is, by the way, created by fly.io themselves.
    So, I'm going to hit yes just so I can show you how this all works. It's going
    to say app server hidden-fog already exist. You can deploy using fly deploy. Do
    you want still launch a new app? Yes, I want to launch a new app cuz I already
    deployed this to test this out when recording this video. And then I have this
    cool art. I'm just going to hit no. The settings look good to me. And now it's
    going to be deploying my application. I can go back to my dashboard and see server
    bitter violent. I can click on that and I can see that it's pending. It's being
    deployed as we see. You could see the logs right here. I see that the server is
    deployed. If I go to this endpoint, I should see hello world. So, this works.
    Now, if I go to /ass assistance, I see the assistance that I have created. Now,
    I want to test out creating assistance using this endpoint. And in order to do
    that, I need to get an API key from Vappy. So, what I'm going to do is I'm going
    to go to dashboard, click on API keys, and it's great. It's already hidden. All
    I have to do is copy the private key. I'm going to go back to fly.io, and I'm
    going to click secrets, and I'm going to add a secret. And basically, the secret's
    going to be blurred, and the API key name is going to be vap_appi_key. I'm going
    to set secret, and then now I'm going to deploy secrets because I'm adding a new
    environment variable, a new secret. It's going to have to redeploy. and you're
    going to see in just a couple of seconds. I'm going to have it redeployed and
    we're going to test out this voice AI agent server of ours. Okay, so our server
    has been deployed with the secret key. Let's test it out. I have a curl request
    here with the URL/ass assistance. I'm going to create a new assistant. Let's call
    this assistant uh what's the cool name? Let's call it Johnny. We're going to call
    our assistant Johnny Bravo. And the first message is gonna be hello, how can I
    help you? Let's keep it simple. I'm going to hit enter. And we see that the assistant
    has been created. Now, if we go back to our Vappy dashboard and we click on assistance
    and we refresh, we see our Johnny Bravo assistant has been created. Now, let's
    create a new phone number. I'm doing a post request to /phone numbers. And we're
    going to call this phone number mainline, but let's give it a actually main line
    number one just so we can differentiate it from the one we created. I'm going
    to hit enter. And we are going to see that our phone number has been created.
    But and again, if I go to the Vap dashboard, I click on phone numbers. I see that
    this has just been created. It takes two minutes to activate. Now, the last curl
    request, we're going to update the assistant to have this phone number. We're
    going to attach this phone number to the assistant. I'm using patch. And finally,
    I fired off the last curl request. And this basically attaches the phone number
    to the assistant. If I go back to Vappy and I refresh the phone number, you're
    going to see something very important here. You see that the assistant that's
    attached to this phone number is Johnny Bravo. Right? So, that being said, if
    I call this number, which I'm going to right now, it's 2075075367. I'm calling
    it right now. As you can see, >> hello. How can I help you today? We built our
    voice agent. And that is pretty much it for this video, ladies and gentlemen.

  - start: 00:00:28
    text: first things first, let's look at this
  - start: 00:00:30
    text: voice agent platform that I'm building.
  - start: 00:00:32
    text: It's for businesses, but in this case,
  - start: 00:00:34
    text: we're going to use it to prank call my
  - start: 00:00:36
    text: friend. So, I'm going to create a new
  - start: 00:00:38
    text: business. We're going to call this Prank
  - start: 00:00:39
    text: Call Central. Uh, we're going to leave
  - start: 00:00:41
    text: the description blank. We don't have to
  - start: 00:00:43
    text: add a knowledge base, but I have it in
  - start: 00:00:44
    text: such a way where, like, if you're a
  - start: 00:00:46
    text: business, you can add all your knowledge
  - start: 00:00:47
    text: base. And this will be the voice agent
  - start: 00:00:49
    text: will have access to all this
  - start: 00:00:50
    text: information. So, we're just going to
  - start: 00:00:51
    text: skip for now. Phone number, we're going
  - start: 00:00:53
    text: to call this the mainline. Area code
  - start: 00:00:55
    text: 207. We're going to buy the number and
  - start: 00:00:58
    text: I'm going to show you the platform we're
  - start: 00:00:59
    text: using to build all this stuff. Now,
  - start: 00:01:01
    text: we're going to configure the agent.
  - start: 00:01:02
    text: We're going to call it prank call agent
  - start: 00:01:06
    text: and it says you're a prank call agent. I
  - start: 00:01:08
    text: don't want it to be a helpful voiceful
  - start: 00:01:09
    text: assistant. You are going to be rude and
  - start: 00:01:13
    text: disrespectful
  - start: 00:01:15
    text: to the person
  - start: 00:01:17
    text: that you call. Make fun of their
  - start: 00:01:22
    text: forehead and tell them to lock in. I
  - start: 00:01:26
    text: think this is a a great um this is a
  - start: 00:01:29
    text: great start. I don't want the first
  - start: 00:01:30
    text: message to be hello, how can I help you?
  - start: 00:01:32
    text: The first message to be what's up
  - start: 00:01:36
    text: bro. Super disrespectful. All right,
  - start: 00:01:39
    text: we're going to have open AI GBT40. I
  - start: 00:01:41
    text: will just have it be the default voice
  - start: 00:01:43
    text: and then we'll have my number be the
  - start: 00:01:45
    text: transfer number and we're going to click
  - start: 00:01:47
    text: create assistant. So the assistant has
  - start: 00:01:49
    text: been created. I'm going to go to go to
  - start: 00:01:51
    text: dashboard. So now I see my phone number
  - start: 00:01:54
    text: is being activated. It's going to take a
  - start: 00:01:56
    text: minute for it to activate. While that's
  - start: 00:01:58
    text: the case, I'm going to show you the
  - start: 00:01:59
    text: platform that I'm using. The platform
  - start: 00:02:01
    text: that I'm using to build the AI agents,
  - start: 00:02:03
    text: the voice AI agents, is Vappy. And Vapy
  - start: 00:02:05
    text: is an excellent platform with an even
  - start: 00:02:08
    text: better API. Not only can you build
  - start: 00:02:11
    text: agents, you can give these agents tools.
  - start: 00:02:13
    text: You can create squads, which is like
  - start: 00:02:15
    text: multiple agents. You can give them
  - start: 00:02:16
    text: knowledge bases. Like there's so much
  - start: 00:02:18
    text: you can do. Like Vappy is actually an
  - start: 00:02:21
    text: excellent platform if you're trying to
  - start: 00:02:22
    text: build anything voice related. So
  - start: 00:02:24
    text: basically the app I've built wraps
  - start: 00:02:26
    text: around Vappy all the services and it
  - start: 00:02:29
    text: presents it in a nice beautiful user
  - start: 00:02:31
    text: experience for business owners. Now I
  - start: 00:02:33
    text: can see I have no knowledge base but I
  - start: 00:02:35
    text: can see the assistants that have been
  - start: 00:02:36
    text: created. I can click on the prank call
  - start: 00:02:38
    text: assistant. I see some information here.
  - start: 00:02:40
    text: I see the system prompt here. I would
  - start: 00:02:42
    text: get the call history. There are no calls
  - start: 00:02:44
    text: here. I can like make changes to the AI
  - start: 00:02:47
    text: agent if I want to. And here I can
  - start: 00:02:49
    text: attach a number to this agent. So when
  - start: 00:02:51
    text: someone calls this number, the agent's
  - start: 00:02:53
    text: going to answer or the agent's going to
  - start: 00:02:55
    text: when the agent calls somebody, this is
  - start: 00:02:56
    text: the number they're going to use. And
  - start: 00:02:58
    text: they can also, if someone requests a
  - start: 00:03:00
    text: transfer, they can transfer the call to
  - start: 00:03:02
    text: my number. So I'm going to just select
  - start: 00:03:05
    text: the phone number that we created. The
  - start: 00:03:07
    text: phone number has been assigned now. So
  - start: 00:03:09
    text: now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
  - start: 00:03:10
    text: get the agent to call my best friend.
  - start: 00:03:13
    text: And here's hoping he answers. Okay. So
  - start: 00:03:17
    text: I've entered my friend's number and
  - start: 00:03:19
    text: we're going to click start call.
  - start: 00:03:22
    text: And hopefully in a couple of minutes.
  - start: 00:03:26
    text: Okay, so it says call started. So
