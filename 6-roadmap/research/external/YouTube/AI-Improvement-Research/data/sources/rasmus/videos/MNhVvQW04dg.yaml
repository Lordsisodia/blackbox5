  full_text: Just a couple days ago, we were all talking about how amazing Gemini
    3 Pro was at everything, even at programming. But 3 days ago, Enthropic said,
    "This is what I'm about to drop." And they dropped Opus 4.5, which by far, ladies
    and gents, in the last 3 days I've been using it, is the best coding model I've
    ever had to use. There are some cons I will talk about at the very end. But my
    goodness, out of all the models that exist, this by far is the best one. So, in
    this video, we're going to talk about the model, the pricing, how to best use
    it, the project I was using it with, and my personal experience, and I have some
    tips and tricks to share with you to make sure you get the best out of this model.
    So, sit back, relax, let's get into it. Cloud [snorts] Opus 4.5. This launched
    November 24th, 2025. Now, when it comes to the benchmarks, especially the ones
    that matter to us developers, it is kicking butt. It is winning. The only benchmarks
    I think it's losing on is graduate level reasoning, visual reasoning, and multilingual
    Q&A, which you and I don't care for, right? Because if you're watching this, you're
    looking to build software. You're either a developer or you're someone who uses
    AI tools to build software or you're both. And in that case, this stuff doesn't
    really matter to us. But everything else, the tool calling is by far, in my opinion,
    the best. Even though I enjoyed Gemini 3 Pro, there were times I noticed it mess
    up with its tool calling. Opus 4.5, in my humble opinion, seems to be the best.
    Now, in terms of pricing, it's $5 per million tokens in, $25 per million tokens
    out. In terms of comparison with the previous Opus 4.1, this is 66% cheaper than
    the Opus 4.1 model. Now, obviously, this isn't the cheapest model, but I will
    say this, this is a bang for your buck. This is the best ROI. like you are getting
    a great model at a cheaper price compared to 4.1 cuz 4.1 was astronomically expensive.
    Most of you know the project I'm working on bird terminal which is what I call
    the trading terminal for the AI age or the Bloomberg for Gen Z's. And there were
    a couple issues I had with the chart page and even with the workflow system I
    had built and I'm just going to show you the PR. This is the one that Opus cooked.
    Mind you, these were three prompts, right? And you see this giant PR with all
    these file changes. It got it all at once. The reason why I'm saying three prompts,
    there was a couple things I had to clear for it. And this is what I like about
    OPOS 4.5. It's one of those models where if your prompt is clear and you give
    it the resources, meaning I attached docs a couple of times, like I gave it the
    specific docs that needed to ingest, it did it expeditiously. I hope that's a
    word, expeditiously well. And what I mean by my workflows is it's this feature
    basically you have this node style environment where you can drag a trigger, right?
    So in this case, I have a time trigger and I can specify, okay, 9:45 a.m. we'll
    make this reoccurring. So, every single day, we can make this weekly, we I'll
    make this daily. You're going to buy 10 shares of the Coinbase stock, right? And
    all I do is save this workflow and that's it. I even have a web hook one where
    you can trigger this via web hook. So, if I save this workflow and I click here,
    this is the web hook I would fire to and this trade would trigger. Now, I had
    built this feature out, but there were some quirks and some kinks that I was just
    too lazy to figure out. So, I gave it to Opus 4.5 and in one shot fixed it. It
    worked. And my day job at Convex, I've also been working on a Stripe component,
    something that a lot of people have been asking for. And if you're not familiar
    with Convex components, they're basically blocks of code that work with Convex
    projects that give you some sort of functionality. For example, let's say you
    wanted to build an AI agent. You're probably going to scaffold the same code.
    Like the structure of the code is generally going to be the same. So, instead
    of writing the same thing again and again, you have an AI agent component. And
    we also have a polar one, autumn one, but a lot of people have been asking for
    stripe and I was working on that. And I had already built a component out myself.
    But I gave it to Opus45 to check for any edge cases I had missed for. And Opus
    caught four things that I had slipped. And not only did it correct them, but it
    wrote tests. It built me an example app using the component. And not even lying,
    the code was actually pretty good. Like there was minimal cleanup that I had to
    do. By now, I hope you're convinced that Opus 4.5, if you haven't given it a shot,
    you might as well cuz arguably there is no one who could tell you that there is
    a model that's better than 4.5 right now. Now, there are some cons to this model
    or some shortfallings I've seen. Number one, it is sort of eager. If you guys
    remember, I don't know if it was Claude Sonnet 3.1 or one of the early models.
    Um, it was a very eager model. like you ask it to fix one thing, it would go do
    front-end changes, it would rewrite your database, and it was just a terrible
    experience. Now, I'm not saying Opus 4.5 does that all the time, but I've noticed
    it has a tendency sometimes to go above and beyond. It feels like an excited junior
    developer wants to prove himself or herself to you. So, there is that tendency
    with Opus 45. I've noticed it a couple times. So, just make sure you're not just
    accepting randomly that you actually review the code it generates. Now, I've been
    using Opus 45 a lot on cursor. Actually, mainly on cursor. And one thing I've
    realized is when the context window reaches about 70%, it starts to not get as
    good. So, if I were you, the moment I I see 70% context window reached on cursor
    or whatever tool you're using, I would just open a new tab and start again. Realistically,
    I would cut off at 50%. Because you don't want to dump too much context. You don't
    want to pollute the context, per se. And another thing that I found extremely
    useful is if you give it the right documentation, code snippets, like we would
    do this with other models before, but I am telling you, every time I've given
    it documentation, it's followed it to the tea. And this is even internal docs
    or docs that I've created or code snippets that I've written, giving it has resulted
    in much better outputs. So, if you haven't already, what are you doing? Check
    out this model. It is exceptional. It is amazing. It is decently fast. like it's
    not composer fast, but it's decently fast. And I've even seen people maybe combine
    different models if the price is too high. What you can do is you can use it to
    plan and then use composer to write the code. Either way, I'm 4.5 p. This is the
    best model for coding. I haven't used anything else. The results are amazing and
    I hope you enjoyed this video. I want to do a video on how to use 4.5 when designing
    uh your web apps because I will say the one weakness I did notice is it's not
    the best with design. Although if you attach a screenshot of a site that you like
    and pass it um in the prompt, it's actually pretty good at mimicking existing
    design systems. So that's, you know, a free tip I'll give you right there. You
    take a screenshot of a page that you like. Let's say you like the enthropic page
    here. You like the colors and the font. I would p I would take a screenshot of
    this, pass it into the in the into the chat and say match the colors, the fonts,
    um, and change the global.css file. It actually crushes, right? So, maybe I'll
    do another video talking about this. Let me know in the comments down below. Thank
    you so much for watching. Make sure to like, comment, subscribe, and I will see
    you in the next one. Peace.
