  full_text: So, I want to talk about crypto. Wait, before you close the video, it's
    because I posted this tweet I wrote saying, "Yeah, just messing with some crypto
    SDKs and there are so many meaningful things that can be built, but everyone wants
    to build a,000x leverage memecoin garbage." And I genuinely do believe this. In
    today's video, I want to talk about my experience in the crypto web 3 space. I
    want to talk about some cool ideas I've worked on or may be working on. I'm going
    to share with you some APIs, SDKs that you can play with today. And finally, I'm
    going to tell you why majority of the stuff you see in this space is straight
    garbage and a scam. I hope you got your popcorn. Sit back, relax. Let's get into
    the video. Now, I don't know if you know this, but I've been in the crypto trenches
    since 2017. I remember buying Bitcoin and Ethereum from the Coinbase app in Canada.
    And it was so early that you couldn't even sell your crypto. It was a crazy time.
    And then there were these things called ICOs, which were basically crowdfunding.
    And there was a lot of money made. There was a lot of money lost. And I'd been
    pretty active in the space from 2017 all the way up to like 2022. And the reason
    why I say 2022 is 2022 it all changed for me because that's when I decided to
    learn how to code. And I sort of owe the space this because I wanted to build
    a tool that I saw was lacking. But I couldn't find a developer to do it. So I
    was like, you know what, I'm going to learn how to write to code. And the journey
    began in 2022. Now, by 2023, I had launched a web3 startup called Orkit, and it
    had about $150,000 active users, did about $3 million in transactions in like
    3 to 4 months. It was crazy. It was booming. Now, you might be asking, Mike, if
    you had a startup like that, where's it at now? Long story short, I had started
    it originally with a friend, onboarded another friend on, and me and that friend
    that I onboarded ended up having a dispute. Things didn't work out. I just up
    and left. Now, in hindsight, it was probably a bad decision to leave with no equity,
    no cash, but I trusted God, and look where we're at now. We're doing pretty good.
    Glory to Jesus. So, I say that all to say, I'm not just someone in the tech space
    who just hates crypto or web 3 um for the sake of hating it. I have justified
    reasons to hate the space. I don't think I've ever heard anyone say that they're
    a justified hater, but that's what I'm basically trying to say. Now, here's the
    thing. Every now and then, I've had a cool idea that somewhat encompasses web
    3 or crypto, and it's actually pretty fun. Like for example, the idea of decentralized
    finance is cool to me. Why? Being able to transact without banks oversight, [music]
    being able to access markets 24/7, being able to get a loan with collateral that
    you put down. Like these things, I know in the west we take for granted, but in
    many countries where there's a lot of government oversight and there's, you know,
    not a lot of access to these type of instruments, this is amazing. This was the
    promise of crypto that was exciting early on in the early days. But unfortunately,
    that's not where we're at right now. Right now where we're at is thousandx memecoin
    long Trumpcoin to the moon like all this garbage and pumping and and it's all
    fun in games when people are making money. But we've seen how destructive leverage
    can get especially in this space. But we'll talk about that at the end. Here's
    a cool idea I had in one of the recent videos I made. I shared with you a product
    I was working on called Bur AI which is basically a trading terminal. I'm calling
    it the Bloomberg for Gen Z. And I was working on the trading execution layer.
    basically uh what brokerage APIs you can fire off trades to and all that stuff.
    And I sat there and I thought for a second, it'd be cool if there was a way where
    I can have trades going without having to use some sort of brokerage. And this
    is what I thought of. Imagine, right, a client authenticates with Google and in
    authenticating with Google, a a wallet gets created for them. They don't have
    to remember a seed phrase or anything like this. All this gets abstracted for
    them [music] and then they can use an on-ramp basically their card to fund that
    account but it's a wallet in the back end right but let's say they're funding
    an air account the UX would feel non-cryptolike and this is the one thing the
    sucky thing about most crypto apps is they feel like crypto apps and we don't
    want that the general public does not want that so imagine you use your Google
    um it creates a wallet for you in the back end you can fund that wallet with your
    card right so it doesn't even feel like you're using crypto and you can trade
    stocks but they wouldn't be the actual asset, it'd be synthetic assets, assets
    that mirror tokens that mirror the [music] exact price. So, I went down a rabbit
    hole and I was researching how I could make this happen. So, the way it would
    happen is let's say um I wanted to buy Tesla stock on this platform, right? When
    the person funds their account, that would be converted to some sort of stable
    coin. That stable coin would then be deposited into a smart contract that I would
    have to build and that smart contract would mint a new token that would be representing
    that asset, right? let's say Tesla in this instant you can see it in this diagram
    and the way we would track the price of that uh asset because we're not holding
    the actual asset is we would have to connect to some sort of oracle which is basically
    uh a technology that allows you to get information from the internet or third
    party sources into the blockchain cuz the blockchain is not connected to the internet
    right the blockchain itself I know it runs on the internet but it's not connected
    to the internet so you use an oracle for that and this all was pretty exciting
    because what I essentially envisioned is the ability for anyone to buy stocks
    without having to own the actual underlying asset, without having to go through
    hoops and it would be 247 and it was exciting. But I thought of one problem. I'm
    like, how would we handle someone taking profits, right? So the price of the asset
    went up and they sell, they need to make the difference. They need the difference,
    right? So how would we handle that? And obviously GPT5 came with clutch answers,
    but basically either the protocol, so the business would have to have money, there
    had to be a liquidity pool, meaning people would pull in, people would put in
    funds in this pool and then they would get fees for the amount of money that's
    transferred in and out. There's automated market makers you can build. There's
    a lot of stuff that you can do. And while I was doing this research, I realized
    surely someone should have done this before. And I saw like that there were a
    couple companies back in the day who tried and who were doing it, but got shut
    down for regulatory reasons. makes sense. [music] And there's one actively working
    on it right now. Um it they had a join weight list thing. [music] So um I don't
    know if they making it happen, what's going on, but this sounded like a cool idea
    and it's the crypto that makes it cool and I wish we would focus on more stuff
    like this. Another idea I had and this is a simple one. I don't know if you guys
    are familiar with GTA RP servers, but an RP server is a roleplay server. And basically,
    you have like these servers that run GTA 5, but there are a lot of modifications.
    Like, it actually makes the game 100 times. But if you if you like GTA and you've
    never been in an RP [music] server, just YouTube one right now and check it out.
    It's pretty cool. But anyway, for those of you who know, you know that there are
    these economies and you can buy and sell things. Um, but it's all like in-game
    currency and in-game items. Now imagine if the currency was actually a tradable
    token and imagine if the government is like a smart contract that regulates the
    economy right increases decreases taxes like you can create the logic for this
    you can even have an AI run this like that would be so cool and the assets cars
    the houses and all these type of things close are all NFTs right like this is
    a use case [music] where it makes sense this is a use case where this is cool
    and this is why early on in 2017 2018 I was a big web three, bro. Because this
    stuff, this is the stuff that was promised to us. Instead, what did we get? We
    got meme coins about animals. We got 50x, 100x leverage. In what world is 100x
    leverage something that we should offer to people, [music] you know, to the founders
    of all these companies that provide 50x, 100x leverage to say you're offering
    uh trading instruments to the broad public. No, you're a gambling platform. That's
    what it is. We're in an era where gambling is cool. Everyone wants to gamble.
    They want to gamble on who's president, who's this, who's eating, who's doing
    this. And crypto has become just another place to gamble. And there are a lot
    of issues with the space, right? Decentralization has a UX problem, right? People
    don't want it to feel like crypto. And when it feels like crypto, it just it's
    not a great user experience. Unfortunately, it's a great place for criminals to
    transact, right? To clean money and do the all these things, right? Decentralization
    is cool until you realize criminals exist. I talked about the leverage. I hate
    it. And [music] if this is not just me being a hater, but in October, literally
    last month, there was the largest crypto liquidation event in history. What do
    I mean by this? People who even had 2x leverage got liquidated. I'm in a couple
    of Discord chats and people who I've seen and know made millions of dollars in
    the market lost it all because all these instruments that are available to you,
    um, it it it does like this market just promotes degeneracy. That's what it is.
    I mean, people would call themselves I even used to call myself a DJ. So, this
    is why I I I hate the space. Although there's some cool tech and there's some
    cool companies, I genuinely am not a fan of the space. I used to love the space
    and there's a part of me that kind of still does, but it was because of the idea
    of actually creating decentralized finance, creating protocols for people to be
    able to transact financially without a third party overseer. To me, it meant freedom
    from tyrannical governments or banks doing what banks do. And the way the community
    decided to fight the man was by offering people thousandx leverage. Anyway, I
    can continue on my rant about how much the space frustrates me. It's from a place
    of love. Like, you know, the the tough love type of thing that that's what it
    is right now. But there are some cool APIs that I want to share with you that
    you should probably play with, right? If you are a Typescript person just like
    myself, you [music] can spin up some simple apps and see what you could do with
    it. There's third web, which is like the toolkit for all things. you want to generate
    wallets, you want to run transactions. Um, it's a pretty cool uh company. These
    are actually the same guys that run Founders Inc., which is pretty interesting.
    And then you have Crossmint as well. This is like another wallet infrastructure
    company. You have Privy, another wallet infrastructure company. So, this idea
    of like people logging in with like their Google or whatever and that having a
    wallet address attached to it and then being able to transact with that, that
    stuff is is cool to me. There's a lot of cool things you can do with that. And
    then there's VM, which is this lightweight library where you can use to basically
    build anything on the Ethereum blockchain. And it's a well structured library.
    So again, I'll link all the stuff in the description. Check it out. And man, I
    have so many ideas, so many things that could be built, but it's just like the
    space frustrates me. A lot of the people who are leaders in the space, all they
    promote is degeneracy and gambling and thousandx leverage. There's some cool stuff
    that can be built. Maybe one day we'll make it happen, maybe not. For now, these
    are my thoughts. I hope you enjoyed this video. So, make sure to like, comment,
    subscribe, hit the notification bell. Let me know what you think about this space.
    And until next time, I will see you in the next video.

  - start: 00:01:53
    text: say that all to say, I'm not just
  - start: 00:01:54
    text: someone in the tech space who just hates
  - start: 00:01:57
    text: crypto or web 3 um for the sake of
  - start: 00:01:59
    text: hating it. I have justified reasons to
  - start: 00:02:01
    text: hate the space. I don't think I've ever
  - start: 00:02:02
    text: heard anyone say that they're a
  - start: 00:02:04
    text: justified hater, but that's what I'm
  - start: 00:02:05
    text: basically trying to say. Now, here's the
  - start: 00:02:07
    text: thing. Every now and then, I've had a
  - start: 00:02:08
    text: cool idea that somewhat encompasses web

  - start: 00:02:16
    text: Why? Being able to transact without

    text: banks oversight, [music] being able to
  - start: 00:02:20
    text: access markets 24/7, being able to get a

    text: loan with collateral that you put down.

    text: oversight and there's, you know, not a
  - start: 00:02:33
    text: lot of access to these type of
  - start: 00:02:34
    text: instruments, this is amazing. This was
  - start: 00:02:37
    text: the promise of crypto that was exciting

    text: early on in the early days. But
  - start: 00:02:40
    text: unfortunately, that's not where we're at
  - start: 00:02:42
    text: right now. Right now where we're at is
  - start: 00:02:43
    text: thousandx memecoin long Trumpcoin to the
  - start: 00:02:46
    text: moon like all this garbage and pumping
  - start: 00:02:49
    text: and and it's all fun in games when
  - start: 00:02:51
    text: people are making money. But we've seen
  - start: 00:02:52
    text: how destructive leverage can get

    text: idea I had in one of the recent videos I
