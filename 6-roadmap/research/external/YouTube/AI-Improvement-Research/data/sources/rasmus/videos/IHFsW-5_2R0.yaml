  full_text: React 19 changed everything. The mental model of React that we once had
    requires a little bit of change, a little bit of shift as React moves toward the
    server. A lot of people are referring to React as async React. In today's video,
    I'm going to be sharing with you the two big changes that apply to us developers
    when we're building web applications using React. So, let's get straight into
    the video. I built a simple demo app to show us some of these React 19 changes.
    suspense plus use hook and the activity component. Let's start with the activity
    component. So what is the activity component? And the best way I can explain it
    to you by showing you a demo. You have a tab here that is being rendered using
    the activity component and you have a tab here that's being rendered using conditionals.
    So here's one thing I want you to check. So in the selection of the all tab, I'm
    going to type Michael in all posts. Now, if I'm conditionally rendering this,
    when I click on active and I go back, what I filled in the input should disappear.
    But what the activity component does is it maintains the state when I'm on the
    other tab. But if I do this here where I type in Michael and I click on active
    and I go back to all, I lose that state. So to summarize, what the activity component
    allows you to do is to preserve component state during a transition. And the code
    for this is pretty simple. You're going to import activity from React. I also
    have a use state here to set the active tab. I have tab one as the active tab.
    So you see these two buttons right here. These are the tabs [music] I have right
    here. If I scroll down all and active. So these are the tabs. And now here's how
    you use the activity component. [music] In the activity component you have mode.
    And then you can specify if the current tab that I've wrapped, if the current
    content that I've wrapped should be visible or hidden. Right? So in this case,
    I have this use state that controls which tab is selected. Uh the default tab
    is tab one. But if I click on the second tab, tab two, then we're going to set
    that to active. And basically what this does is it checks if active tab is tab
    one, then this activity is [music] visible. If it's not tab one, this is hidden,
    right? So, pretty simple. All I do is wrap the components with the activity component.
    And then in mode, I specify whether it's visible or hidden. [music] And here's
    what's cool about activity. Whatever state is in the activity bounds, when it
    switches from visible to hidden, that state is maintained. That is why I can type
    some numbers here, click all, go back to active, that state is preserved. So,
    some key takeaways about activity. State preservation. Activity keeps components
    alive in the background, maintaining their state. Better UX. Users don't lose
    their place, focus, or typed content when navigating. When to use perfect for
    tabs, wizards, multi-step forms, or any UI where you want to preserve state between
    views. Performance avoids expensive reinitialization of components on every view
    switch. The activity component is necessary for us to know. Because this is available
    in React, you can use this in Tanstack start, Nex.js, Remix, React Start, whatever
    React meta framework you use, the activity component is available. And you can
    see [music] here in the tab that doesn't use the activity component. I'm basically
    conditionally rendering and this does not preserve the state. So now let's talk
    about suspense plus the use hook. Gone are the days where you're going to be using
    use effect to fetch data in your React apps. I'm going to show you how to fetch
    data using use and suspense in React. Let's look at the code. So I have this suspense
    page [music] and in this suspense page I have a page called data page where I
    get posts [music] and this get post is a function that basically reads from a
    database uh 10 posts and then [music] returns success true and the post and then
    I get post promise. But what do I do with this promise? How do I get the contents
    from the promise? I take postpromise [music] and what I do is I'm going to show
    you right here. I pass postpromise [music] to this component called data content.
    If I click on data content, [music] I'm going to see this is a component right
    here. And in this component, I receive the post promises. This is a promise. And
    then how I get the data out of the promise is I'm using use [music] from React.
    Now, here's what's cool about use. Use is a React API that lets you read the value
    of a resource like a promise or context. So you give it a promise, a context.
    Use can pull the data that I can then use to render on my component. So this is
    how simple it is to use use. I basically get the promise, right? In this case,
    get post. I don't await it. I get the promise. I then pass that post promise to
    the to the component, right? Which this component will probably render the data.
    And in data component what I essentially do I'll zoom in so you guys can see clear.
    In data content what I'm going to do is I'm going to pass this promise [music]
    to use and it unwraps the promise and then I can get that data and render [music]
    that data. Now here's one thing that's very important. Notice how the component
    that I pass the promise to is wrapped by the suspense component. And this is very
    important because what happens is as follows. When I refresh this page, notice
    how I have a skeleton and after a few seconds, the data shows. What the suspense
    boundary does is until the data has been unwrapped from the promise, it's going
    to show that loading skeleton. So you see that I see a loading skeleton for a
    bit and then I see my data. So I can use suspense with promises, use, and suspense.
    I have a clean way of fetching data. But wait, there's more to React 19.2 to that
    I want to show you. We have a simple form here where we can create a post. So,
    I'm going to type in Michael and I'm going to say please subscribe. You should
    subscribe if you haven't already. I'm going to click create post. [music] And
    you see the post popped up. But I want to show you again how this interaction
    goes. When I click create post, [music] you see that the button was grayed out
    for a second. It was disabled for a second until the post populated. And once
    the post populated, I'm able to create another post. How are we doing this using
    React 19.2? Let's go back to [music] the suspense page. You're going to see a
    data form component. And I'm just going to enter it here. And in the data form
    component, I [music] have this new hook called use action state. Again, this comes
    from React. This is React 19.2. [music] And use action state gives me state form
    action and is pending. So I see I have a simple form right here. I'm passing in
    the action form action. [music] And what form action is basically doing is firing
    off this create post. This create post is the function that allows me to write
    a post into the database. So if I open this right here, you'll see this is use
    server right here. So this is a server action. And basically what create post
    does is it it gets the title in the body, checks if they exist, and then inserts
    it in the DB and then we revalidate the page. So, make sure that the data is refreshed.
    That's how if I go back to the form and I create a new post, you see that the
    post pops up right away. The revalidate path [music] function allows me to do
    that. And then, not only have I passed in create post, but I've also passed in
    null. And if we look at the docs, essentially what null is, it's the initial state.
    And because this is a form, I expect you to fill it out. So, the initial state
    is null. And so basically all I have to do to make this form work using use action
    state is I pass the form action to action. And we saw basically how create post
    works. It's going to get the title and the body from the form. You see form data
    get title form data get body right? I get that from these inputs right here. The
    state basically allows me to check if any errors have occurred. Like for example,
    if I go back to the form and if I type in the title and I hit create post, you
    see title and body are required. I get that from [music] state and is pending
    basically lets me know that the request is still pending. It hasn't been complete
    yet. And if it's not complete, the button should be disabled. Now, if I were to
    make this a bit slower for us to see this, what I'm going to do is right here,
    I'm going to add a promise. Let's make it a bit long, right? I'm going to save
    this and let's submit this form again. So, I'm going to hit create post. Notice
    how this is grayed out. So I can't click, I can't do, you know, I can't create
    another post. I have to wait for this request to resolve because is pending is
    still true. [music] And that makes it disabled. And then you see the contents
    are updated. So use action state. Another great hook, especially with forms. But
    here's another cool thing I'd like to show you with React 19. Watch when I delete
    these posts how it grays out for a second, request is firing, and then I can delete
    another one. How am I doing this using React 19? If I go back to data content,
    you see I'm using use to [music] unwrap the data. And then I pass the data to
    again a new hook from React 19 called use optimistic. [music] And use optimistic
    basically allows me to manage the state of my optimistic updates. [music] So I
    pass the data into use optimistic. So the most up-to-date state of my data and
    then I pass in what the optimistic update looks like. In this case, what we're
    doing is we're deleting posts. So I'm going to use filter to filter out the post
    that's going to get deleted. So in doing so, I now get the optimistic post. So
    this is what I'll be rendering on the JSX. And then I have remove optimistic post.
    This is going to be used in my handle delete function. And in my handle delete
    function, you see another thing here called star transition that comes from the
    use transition hook. And one of the reasons why I'm using use transition here
    is so I can get the pending state. So in start transition I call remove optimistic
    post and then I actually call the delete post function which if I click here it's
    basically [music] deleting it from the DB. Right? Pretty simple stuff. But this
    start transition allows me to have this is pending which I can then pass into
    the JSX into the class name to gray out the posts. So here I can again create
    a bunch of posts. I can do that. You see like I see the updates instantly [music]
    and then I can delete these posts. The is pending allows me to make sure that
    no other action happens until everything's deleted. And ladies and gents, with
    these new React 19 primitives, you can build beautiful [music] user experiences.
    Now here's the thing. I tried to use as many of the new React 19 features that
    we got. You don't have to use all of these, but I wanted to show you how these
    all work together. But that is pretty much it, ladies and gents, for this video.

    text: component? And the best way I can

    text: explain it to you by showing you a demo.

    text: You have a tab here that is being

    text: rendered using the activity component
  - start: 00:00:42
    text: and you have a tab here that's being
  - start: 00:00:44
    text: rendered using conditionals. So here's
  - start: 00:00:46
    text: one thing I want you to check. So in the
  - start: 00:00:49
    text: selection of the all tab, I'm going to
  - start: 00:00:51
    text: type Michael in all posts. Now, if I'm
  - start: 00:00:54
    text: conditionally rendering this, when I
  - start: 00:00:56
    text: click on active and I go back, what I
  - start: 00:00:59
    text: filled in the input should disappear.
  - start: 00:01:01
    text: But what the activity component does is
  - start: 00:01:03
    text: it maintains the state when I'm on the
  - start: 00:01:06
    text: other tab. But if I do this here where I
  - start: 00:01:08
    text: type in Michael and I click on active
  - start: 00:01:10
    text: and I go back to all, I lose that state.
  - start: 00:01:13
    text: So to summarize, what the activity
  - start: 00:01:15
    text: component allows you to do is to
  - start: 00:01:17
    text: preserve component state during a
  - start: 00:01:19
    text: transition. And the code for this is
  - start: 00:01:21
    text: pretty simple. You're going to import
  - start: 00:01:23
    text: activity from React. I also have a use
  - start: 00:01:25
    text: state here to set the active tab. I have
  - start: 00:01:28
    text: tab one as the active tab. So you see
  - start: 00:01:30
    text: these two buttons right here. These are
  - start: 00:01:32
    text: the tabs [music] I have right here. If I
  - start: 00:01:33
    text: scroll down all and active. So these are
  - start: 00:01:37
    text: the tabs. And now here's how you use the
  - start: 00:01:40
    text: activity component. [music] In the
  - start: 00:01:42
    text: activity component you have mode. And
  - start: 00:01:44
    text: then you can specify if the current tab
  - start: 00:01:48
    text: that I've wrapped, if the current
  - start: 00:01:49
    text: content that I've wrapped should be
  - start: 00:01:51
    text: visible or hidden. Right? So in this
  - start: 00:01:53
    text: case, I have this use state that
  - start: 00:01:55
    text: controls which tab is selected. Uh the
  - start: 00:01:58
    text: default tab is tab one. But if I click
  - start: 00:02:00
    text: on the second tab, tab two, then we're
  - start: 00:02:02
    text: going to set that to active. And
  - start: 00:02:05
    text: basically what this does is it checks if
  - start: 00:02:07
    text: active tab is tab one, then this
  - start: 00:02:09
    text: activity is [music] visible. If it's not
  - start: 00:02:12
    text: tab one, this is hidden, right? So,
  - start: 00:02:14
    text: pretty simple. All I do is wrap the
  - start: 00:02:17
    text: components with the activity component.
  - start: 00:02:19
    text: And then in mode, I specify whether it's
  - start: 00:02:22
    text: visible or hidden. [music] And here's
  - start: 00:02:24
    text: what's cool about activity. Whatever
  - start: 00:02:26
    text: state is in the activity bounds, when it
  - start: 00:02:29
    text: switches from visible to hidden, that
  - start: 00:02:31
    text: state is maintained. That is why I can
  - start: 00:02:34
    text: type some numbers here, click all, go
  - start: 00:02:37
    text: back to active, that state is preserved.
  - start: 00:02:40
    text: So, some key takeaways about activity.
  - start: 00:02:42
    text: State preservation. Activity keeps
  - start: 00:02:44
    text: components alive in the background,
  - start: 00:02:45
    text: maintaining their state. Better UX.
  - start: 00:02:47
    text: Users don't lose their place, focus, or
  - start: 00:02:49
    text: typed content when navigating. When to
  - start: 00:02:51

  - start: 00:02:53
    text: multi-step forms, or any UI where you
  - start: 00:02:56
    text: want to preserve state between views.
  - start: 00:02:58
    text: Performance avoids expensive
  - start: 00:03:00
    text: reinitialization of components on every
  - start: 00:03:03

    text: necessary for us to know. Because this

  - start: 00:03:13
    text: use, the activity component is
  - start: 00:03:15
    text: available. And you can see [music] here
  - start: 00:03:16
    text: in the tab that doesn't use the activity
  - start: 00:03:18
    text: component. I'm basically conditionally
  - start: 00:03:20
    text: rendering and this does not preserve the
  - start: 00:03:22
    text: state. So now let's talk about suspense
  - start: 00:03:25
    text: plus the use hook. Gone are the days
  - start: 00:03:28
    text: where you're going to be using use

  - start: 00:03:33
    text: I'm going to show you how to fetch data
  - start: 00:03:34
    text: using use and suspense in React. Let's
  - start: 00:03:38
    text: look at the code. So I have this
  - start: 00:03:40
    text: suspense page [music] and in this
  - start: 00:03:42
    text: suspense page I have a page called data
