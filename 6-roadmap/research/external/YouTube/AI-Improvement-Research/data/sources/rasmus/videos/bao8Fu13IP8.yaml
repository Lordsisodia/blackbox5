  full_text: I think we can all agree that chats and UI changed the game. It changed
    the way developers thought about components instead of being these abstract blackbox
    things. They're code that we own in our codebase. But one thing a lot of people
    started to complain about Shhatzu and UI is a lot of apps started to look the
    same. They started to look like Shhatzen apps. With today's launch of Shhatzian
    create, all of that changes. Introducing Shhatzyen create. Build your own Shhatzen
    UI. Customize everything. Pick your component library, icons, base color, theme,
    fonts. Build something that doesn't look like everything else. We're just going
    to get straight into it. Now, if we go to the Shatsen UI site, something is different.
    It says new project now. So, if I click on new project, I am met with this Shatsen
    UI builder. It says here, build your own Shatsen UI. When you're done, click create
    project to start a new project. So, we're going to customize the look and feel
    of our Shatsen UI component library. So, first things first, we can choose a different
    base layer. Previously, it used to just be Radix UI, but now it's base UI. And
    if you aren't familiar with B UI, B UI is basically built by the same people who
    built Radics UI. And if you're wondering why we need Radics UI or B UI, believe
    me, these unstyled UI components, they take care of a lot of difficult things
    that you and I as front-end developers, as full stack developers are not thinking
    about. First of all, accessibility. Accessibility is a big thing, a big deal.
    Your apps, your web apps need to be accessible. There are a lot of people who
    don't use the internet like you and me. We have to make it so our web and mobile
    applications are pleasant and easy for them to use. And Radics UI and both Bass
    UI handle this. Now Bass UI seems to be more of the focus and a lot of the Radics
    UI OGs are working on Bass. So I love that that feature is available. So I'm going
    to select base UI. And in terms of style, we have five different styles here.
    Let's go for Nova. reduced padding margins for compact layouts. And then for our
    base color, we're going to pick neutral. Now, for themes, let's let's switch it
    up. Why don't we do a little lime action here? We're going to have a lime theme.
    We're going to keep Lucid as our icon library. And then for font, why don't we
    do something? Yeah, Jet's brain. Jet Brains mono is good. And then for radius,
    we'll do maybe small right there. And then for default colors, we can pick inverted
    default. I'll just leave it at default. And then menu accents will have it as
    bold. Now I can randomize different styles or I can save this right here. So what
    I'm going to do is I'm going to click create project. And now I have a command,
    an MPX command, bunx command. Whichever one you want to use. It works for both
    Nex.js, Tanstack start, and V react. I'll be honest, I don't think I'm the most
    handsome person. >> I think you are. >> Thanks. But you know what needs to look
    good? Your landing pages. And that's where the sponsor of today's video, Framer,
    is going to help. I'm literally going to show you in one minute how to build a
    banger landing page. So, I'm on frame.com. I'm going to log in because I already
    have an account. If you don't have an account, click the link in the description.
    You get two months free. And then here's what I'm not going to do. I'm not going
    to be building a project from scratch. But what you can do is you're going to
    go and search framer templates, right? And then you're going to click on the template
    marketplace. And here's the thing, you can search for whatever category. Let's
    say I wanted to build a page for my business. And here's the cool part. I can
    toggle pricing and click free. All these templates are free for me to use. I can
    click use for free and then I just click copy here and now I have it in my framer
    account ready for me to use. All you have to do is change some colors, change
    some copy and you have a banger, beautiful landing page on your fingertips. Most
    of you know I'm launching a trading app soon. I built the waiting list using Framer.
    You can see how beautiful the animation is when I refresh. You think I built this
    from scratch? No, I used one of the templates, forked it, changed up the copy,
    changed some colors, and I've made it mine. And by the way, every YC startup that
    you know, that you follow, all the big companies, they're all using Framer for
    their landing pages. People will judge a book by its cover. Make sure you use
    Framer. The link is in the description down below. You get two months free with
    their pro plan. Thank you so much, Framer, for sponsoring this video. Now, me
    and the boys and the three girls that watch these videos have no reason to have
    ugly landing pages. Now, here's what's cool about this customization. Shad says
    it here. This goes beyond theming. Your config doesn't just change colors. It
    rewrites the component code to match your setup. Font, spacing, structure, even
    libraries you use. Everything adapts to your preference. The new CLI takes care
    of it all. And now, ladies and gents, why don't we give this a spin? Why don't
    we spin up a new Nex.js application. All I'm going to do is I'm going to copy
    this command, paste this in my terminal. It's going to spin up a new Nex.js project
    for me. We'll call this new shad cn. And just like our regular nextgs npx create
    next app uh cli command. It's going to scaffold a new project but with my shadian
    ui configuration, my own version of shatznui. So I see my nextjs application spun
    up. Let's do npm install. And then we're going to do npm rundev. I get my localhost
    3000. Let's open this up in the browser. Not my cursor browser but my browser
    browser. You can see my shadian configuration in these example components. Now
    when I'm building this application whether I'm using AI or I'm writing code myself
    all these components are available for me to use. The style this configuration
    is available for me to use. And the hope is my app doesn't look like your app
    because you're using Shhatsen UI. And then the beautiful thing about Shats and
    the one thing that we love about it is I own all the code. All the components
    are here. The example component is here as well. And if you're into API design
    and composition, the best way to learn that is to look at all the components in
    the component folder. That being said, that is it for this update. Go check it
    out. Build some beautiful applications that don't look like everybody else's.
    I truly believe Shatian has changed the game. He is the Satoshi of front-end development,
    and I appreciate you watching the video up to this point. Make sure to like, comment,
    subscribe, hit the notification bell. I'll see you guys in the new one.
