  full_text: I want to introduce you to Ralphie. No, it's not the standard Ralph Wigum
    loop or it's not like the Claw Code plug-in. This is my iteration, my version
    of the Ralph loop with a lot of extra tools. And frankly, it's like Superman.
    It can't be beaten. It can't be stopped. It's super powerful. And I'm going to
    show you how it works and how you set it up. Now, when I share this with everybody,
    I did not think it was going to get 1,000 stars in like 2 three days. There's
    a lot of PRs. There's a lot of contribution. People are using it. And what started
    as just a bash loop has now also become a CLI. Now we're all familiar with the
    standard Ralph loop, right? There's going to be a prd file and we're going to
    have the agent go through every single task, every single feature, and it's not
    going to stop until it's done. Now, a lot of people in the comments of the previous
    video were asking me, how different is this from just using cloud code or cursor?
    If you notice when you're using these things, after it's done a feature, it stops.
    What the Ralph loop does or what Ralphie does is you're going to give it all the
    features, the complete PRD, and it's going to continue building it until it's
    done. It's not going to stop until it's done. Now, obviously, just running the
    agent in a loop is not smart. And here's where Ralphie comes with superpowers.
    Every feature that's built, they're going to be test written for it. That's what
    makes Ralphie special. We've given it access to a browser, so it can use a browser
    to test the app that it's building. You have the ability to deploy parallel agents,
    right, and use work trees to have those agents work on separate features so you
    can save time and then it'll merge it together cleanly. And then we also have
    a CLI, right? Ralphie is no longer just a bash script. It's also a CLI that you
    can mpm install and use. Now, you might be wondering, how did I ship all this
    so fast? Well, that's where today's sponsor comes in clutch. Today's sponsor is
    Graptile. I'm going to be completely honest with you. Gravile is the reason I've
    been able to ship so much the last couple weeks. Look, it's cool writing code
    with AI. But here's the sad unfortunate thing. I'm going to go through the Ralphie
    repo. I'm going to go on the pull request and I'm going to show you a close pull
    request. Let's pull maybe a random one right here. Let's pull the browser one
    because that was a pretty monumental PR in my opinion. So, I wrote the code. Majority
    of it was written using claude code and it was working. It was cool. But then
    we let Grapile read a review, run a review, and Gravile caught a bunch of things
    that slipped through the cracks. Now, these are things I didn't even catch because
    I did a code review myself. You can see here now it's outdated because it was
    taken care of. You can see an example here. Here it says config loading only happens
    in main after pars args but functions like is browser available and get browser
    instructions are called during prompt building which happens inside of the run
    brownfield task or prd loop execution if config sets browser to false but it hasn't
    loaded yet when the functions execute browser instructions will be injected based
    on the default browser enabled auto. This was something again. I looked at the
    code. I reviewed it and I missed it and Gravile was able to catch it. Now, you
    might be wondering, I must be on a paid plan or Gravile boosted my account. I'm
    going to take you to the billing section. I'm still on the free trial. I've been
    using the free trial for the last 2 weeks and it's been absolutely cooking. If
    you go on literally all the PRs of Ralphie, especially the closed ones, I can
    show you another one here at streaming process display and setting settings to
    CLI spinner. Like the errors that it catches is monumental. So, if you want to
    ship at lightning speed, make sure to check out Graptile. The link will be in
    the description down below. Don't even just take my word for it. Use the twoe
    free trial. See how fast you ship and not only fast, see how the quality of the
    code increases with Grapple. Again, thank you Grapile for sponsoring the video.
    The link is in the description. So, why don't we set up Ralphie? In order to do
    that, I'm just going to npm install the CLI. I'm pretty sure I already have, but
    just to show you, we're going to npm install the CLI. That's perfect. Now, there
    are a couple of things we could do. We can run it in single task mode, which means
    we just run Ralphie and say, you know, specify the task, or we can use a task
    list, a PRD, so it can continue on going. Now, there's a couple things you can
    also do. You can add some project config. In this case, we can run Ralphie init.
    And I'm going to show you what that does. So, let's run Ralphie init. And we're
    going to see that it detected the project. It created a config.yamel and it added
    a progress.txt as well. Now, what we can do is we can add specific rules so that
    Ralphie follows through like the agent follows through. So, we're going to do
    Ralphie- add rule. I wanted to use Nex.js16 XJS 16, Shatian UI, and Telwind v4.
    So, this is a rule that just got added. Let's continue to look at the repo. We
    can use whatever engine we want. I'll actually use the cursor agent. Again, we
    can specify which file it should view. It can either view a PRD that's markdown
    or it can view a YAML file as well or you can even use GitHub issues. Another
    cool thing is you can have parallel agents running. You can either have a sequential
    mode which is it goes through each task one by one or you can have parallel agents
    running. Again all the information is here down below. You can have some branch
    workflow meaning have a branch per task like each task is its own branch. And
    my favorite one is the ability to have the browser enabled so it can use the browser
    to test. I'm pretty sure it's enabled by default but you can also add the flag-
    browser. So let's use Ralphie. We're going to do Ralphie-PD. The prd file is here.
    It's basically a Trello clone. And I used AI to generate this PRD. Um, we're just
    going to save this PRD right here. Um, and you can look at this. It's just a standard
    PRD. Again, the main thing is we need like a step-by-step checklist for Ralphie
    to use. So, I'm just going to do Ralphie-Prd PRDMD-cursor. We want to use the
    cursor agent and it's going to cook. All the links to Ralphie the website, the
    GitHub repo, all will be linked in the description down below. So I stepped away
    for a few minutes and as you can see the Ralphie loop has been cooking. 10 tasks
    have been done and this folder which was first a prd file only. Now it has a full
    Nex.js app with great structure codes being written. We have our autonomous Ralphie
    loop running. Now a couple things I want to share. I definitely think the Ralphie
    loop and Ralph Wigum as a whole is meant to be used for the AI to build the entirety
    of the thing and then you can step in. I definitely don't think using the Ralphie
    loop and being a human in the loop uh makes sense. If that's the case, I would
    just rather use the agent, right? I could just use cloud code, open code or whatever.
    But I think the power in Ralphie is giving it enough tools where you can steer
    it in the right direction. It has enough of a feedback loop so it can do the right
    things and having a very well-written PRD. I think the stuff that it can build,
    the agent can build autonomously is pretty fantastic. Now, you might be wondering
    what's next? What can we expect next with the Ralphie loop? Now, once we built
    the CLI, something that like lit in my head is, oh, if there was a user interface
    for this where someone can go back and forth with the agent to build out a plan,
    that's the only thing you'll be building out a plan and the rest of the application
    will be built by the AI using a Ralph loop. And then at the end, you can keyway,
    you could give suggestions, you can go back and forth. That would be an awesome
    platform. And I'm calling that Sandstorm. And that's what I've been working on
    literally like the last 24 hours. And the whole premise of this, the way I want
    this to work is I want this to be a place where you organize, you plan out everything.
    You lay out all the tasks and then you leave. And the Ralphie loop is just going
    to continuously work on the background and you're going to come back to an application
    that works. And then you can go back and forth and QA. Times have definitely changed.
    AI has definitely made programming different. I'm writing a lot more code or should
    I say supervising a lot more code. I'm building a lot more projects. But there
    is still that question. Is there an application that is fully built by AI that
    feels like it's not built by AI? I don't know if I've seen one. Maybe the Ralphie
    Loop is going to help us achieve that. I hope you enjoyed this video. Let me know
    if you have any questions down below. Again, all the links will be in the description
    down below. Thank you so much for watching this video. You've been awesome. My
    name is Ross. I'll see you in the next one. Peace.
