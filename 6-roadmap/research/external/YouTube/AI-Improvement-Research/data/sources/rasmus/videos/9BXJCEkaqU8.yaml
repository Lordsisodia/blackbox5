  full_text: We're at a point in the AI race where the big dogs have sort of been
    solidified. Not to say that a new company can't arise and compete, but things
    are pretty solidified in terms of who are the big competitors in the AI space
    fighting for that number one spot. Today's video is a little different because
    I want to present to you a case study where I personally believe Google is going
    to be the winner of the AI race. Now, in recording this video, I want to be completely
    honest. I don't own any Google stock. I probably should, but I don't. With that
    out of the way, let's get straight into the video. [snorts] I'm going to be sharing
    with you again why I think Google's going to win the AI race. But first, let's
    talk about the different verticals that I think are important to capture victory
    in this AI race. You have the companies that manufacture the chips. First, we
    have Nvidia. And let's be honest, Nvidia is winning. The founders are winning,
    the stockholders are winning, the employees are winning. Nvidia has a comfortable
    lead when it comes to chip manufacturing. And they also have a lot of partnerships
    and they also have the government support which is key when it comes to this whole
    AI race. And then you have the companies that are serving inference that are doing
    inference and you have Grock with a Q cerebrous Amazon and Microsoft also partake
    in this. And these companies basically are serving you the AI models via API.
    If you've used the enthropic API, anthropics API in my opinion is terrible. Most
    startups that I've worked at, actually all startups that I've worked at have either
    used Amazon or Microsoft, particularly Amazon Bedrock to have access to these
    models, right? And basically what these inference companies do is they architect
    these hardware setups in order for you to have fast inference, right? So speed
    and reliability is the game here. And then you have the models themselves, right?
    And this is where a lot of competition exists. You have OpenAI, Enthropic, Meta,
    Deep Sea, Kimmy. You have Mistl and all these different labs. We know that the
    big dogs really competing are OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. I definitely think
    Meta can catch up. I wouldn't put it past Z. Z is the same guy. If you remember,
    Instagram was just pictures and videos, right? It was first just pictures, then
    they added videos, and then the boy Zucks tried to buy Snapchat, and Snapchat
    said no. And he did what every mafia boss would do. He punched them in the throat,
    copied their feature, and I have, listen, I have kids in my church who think Instagram
    invented stories, not Snapchat, legitimately, right? This is so I wouldn't put
    it past Zuck. Yes, the llama models kind of suck. They're nowhere to be found.
    But in my opinion, when you look at Zuck's history, he's a mob boss. The the guy
    just knows how to punch companies in the face and do things better than them,
    right? So like you look at the WhatsApp acquisition, you look at him buying Instagram,
    the guy is a genius. So I wouldn't put it past him, but right now it's OpenAI,
    Anthropic, and Google. And then interface, meaning the chat interface or the UI,
    the UX that people are using in order to interact with these models, right? OpenAI
    having Chad GBT. Um the interface itself very popular amongst normies and even
    us developers. And then you have Enthropics, uh Claude.com. I'll be honest, I
    barely use it. Um, not like it breaks. Chat Gvt breaks too. They both suck. This
    is why I use T3 chat. My boy Theo's product. You should check it out if you at
    all use any of the models for developers. Both open a and anthropic are in the
    space. They develop not only models for developers, but also developer tooling,
    right? For like codec cli, cloud code, right? So, they're very much in the developer
    space. And then you have media, right? Image gen, videogen models. I don't think
    any of them have video gen models that are public yet, but media image gen models,
    open AI is in the space. So you see all these different verticals and we see Open
    AAI has their hands in four verticals here. Um, Enthropic really in three, but
    none of them have their hands in every vertical. But this is where Google is different
    cuz if we look at Google Jensen, the three women that watch my videos, one of
    them being my mom, by the way, hi mom if you're watching this. Thanks for watching
    my videos. If you look at this right here, Google is involved in everything. Google
    makes their own chips, TPUs. Google has their own inference. They have their own
    cloud, Vert.Ex AI. You can you can use all the different models like anthropic
    open AI through I don't know about OpenAI, but I know you can use entropic models
    through Vert.Ex. They have their own model, Gemini 3, which is arguably in the
    top two, top three. They have their own interface, the AI studio and Google search.
    Now, here's the thing. I didn't really think about this. If you asked me a couple
    days ago, a couple weeks ago, what is the biggest consumer used AI and I would
    have said Chad GBT. But I watched a video of Theos and he made me realize Chad
    GBT does not have the biggest user product for AI. It's actually search. It's
    actually Google. If I search what do Christians believe about Jesus, I'm gonna
    No, not DS chat. Look, DS chat is pretty good, too. But right here, we're focused
    on Google. So, if I search on Google, notice the first thing that pops up is AI
    overview. This is the most used AI feature. This is the most consumer used AI.
    And then you see Jesus Christ as the son of God, both fully divine, fully human,
    the promised messiah who came to save humanity from their sin in the crucifixion
    and resurrection, offering eternal life to believers. And then, and that he will
    return to judge the world. So, this is the most used AI consumer product. So AI
    Studio, you have search and then you have AI Studio. And this is where Nano Banana
    and all the other Google stuff you can use. It is terrible. The user experience
    is terrible. It's slow. It's buggy. And then you have for devs anti-gravity, which
    is basically their cursor/ uh whatchamacallit their cursor/winsurf competitor.
    It's an IDE. I'm pretty sure it's a fork of VS Code. By the way, all the models
    are free on anti-gravity. What's funny though is even though all the models are
    free because it's pretty bad. A lot of people are not using it. A lot of devs
    are not using it, but they're in that arena as well. And then when it comes to
    media, they have Nano Banana Pro, which is by far the best image gen model. So
    you see that Google is the only company that has their hand in every vertical
    listed here. And not only do they have their hand in every vertical listed here,
    ladies and gents, they also have all the money in the world. Google has all the
    money. They're public and they're profitable. They actually make money. All these
    companies I I can't confidently say about Nvidia. Actually, why don't we just
    search the web? Is Nvidia profitable? I'm not even sure. Okay, so Nvidia is profitable.
    So out of and then Amazon and Microsoft will not consider them. But every other
    company, OpenAI, Anthropic, Deepc, Kimmy, like uh most of these companies, I don't
    want to say every other company, but most of these companies are not profitable.
    Google has all the money in the world. They have literally GDP level money. They
    have one the best talent, right? They have their hand in every pot. Google is
    pretty much set up to kick butt. They're they're pretty much set up to win everywhere.
    Now, here's the thing. I just mentioned to you that anti-gravity sucks. AI Studio
    sucks. So, why am I confident that Google win? Well, here's the thing. Particularly
    with anti-gravity, I actually want to talk about anti-gravity for a second. They
    launched anti-gravity and a lot of people were like, a lot of my favorite dev
    YouTubers and people I respect on Twitter were like, "Yo, this is pretty cheeks."
    Like, it's not pretty good. And here's one thing I realized. There's three types
    of releases in the Silicon Valley company YC raised money VC backed land. There's
    for the love of the game drops, right? Love of the game and then you have the
    make shareholders happy and then there is customers, right? You do it for your
    customers. You do it for your squad. Now, here's the thing. For the love of the
    game, drops are usually like when you when a company does something open source,
    like a big company like Google, they, you know, announce something open source,
    some sort of like thing that's going to help developers and stuff. This is for
    the love of the game, right? There is some benefit to it, but generally there
    are companies that do this and the main reason is for the love of the game. And
    then you have drops to make the shareholders happy, right? For example, GPT 5.2
    is a great example. The model is just not good. But Gemini dropped, Google dropped
    all these things. Nano Banana dropped, and I'm sure the OpenAI team was like,
    "Dang, they're cooking. It looks bad. Let's drop a new model. It might not be
    the best, but it looks good for the shareholders." So, there are things that you
    do to make the shareholders happy. And then third, you do certain things for the
    customers. In my opinion, anti-gravity was more of a number two. The reason why
    it's okay for them to do a number two is because they can turn the number two
    into number three. Meaning, I don't know if you guys know this, but anti-gravity
    sort of stems from Google's aqua hire of Windsurf. They basically bought the Windsurf
    leadership team and took some of the Windsurf code. So, the there's no doubt that
    that team is capable of building something really good, but in my opinion, they
    rush the launch to make shareholders happy. And this is one thing you got to understand.
    Google is capable of building good products or or let's say they're not. Let's
    say they're terrible and they're not. They got the money to buy out anybody. Now,
    if I was Google, I would buy out T3 chat. I would buy out, you know, maybe a cursor,
    right? Well, they bought out Windsor, right? So, they don't have to do that. But
    I'm saying they have the talent and if the talent's not capable enough, they have
    the money, right? So, Google is in a position where if the leadership is smart,
    they essentially can take over every single sphere. There's also another thing
    I have to mention. What Google owns? They own search. They own the most popular
    browser, the gateway to the internet. And they own YouTube. So they got all the
    juicy data in the world. All the vlog data, all the Mr. Beast videos, all the
    Ross Mike videos. You should like, comment, subscribe so the AI can continue to
    scrape these videos. They have all this data. They got all this money. They have
    their hand every singlewhere like in every single vertical. They also have great
    talent and not to get political, but the current administration seems to be very
    fond of big tech companies, right? The America and China are in this arms race
    and the American government is willing to support a lot of the big dogs so that
    they can succeed so America can stay on top so that the land of the free and the
    home of the brave can continue to stay on top. By the way, I'm Canadian. Don't
    get your feelings hurt. I've pretty much glazed Google for the last what eight
    nine 10 minutes. There's one thing Google's known for. I don't know if you're
    familiar with this little known site called Killed by Google. But Google has this
    um behavior of just killing products. Right now, in one hand, it's not a bad idea
    to like, you know, just let go of things that might not be working, but like dang,
    like look at this. Like I'm scrolling. I'm scrolling. I'm scrolling. Right? So,
    it's it's one of those things where it's hard to say, "Oh, Google's going to stick
    to every vertical because they're very known to kill something that they feel
    is not working." But sincerely speaking, what can defeat Google? What can stop
    Google? In my humble opinion, there's two parties. Number one is themselves, right?
    Google can stop Google. Whether it's bad leadership or bad direction, bad vision,
    that is very much possible, right? The giants can be slayed. And number two is
    the government. Although the current administration is favorable, that doesn't
    mean the same administration is going to continue on the next term, right? And
    Google is almost kind of a monopoly, right? So what happens if the government
    deems it as a monopoly and starts to break it up or they are stopped from doing
    a certain acquisition, right? So in my opinion, Google has their own self as ops
    and the government potentially, well, the current administration is favorable.
    And at the end of the day, it doesn't mean they're solid. It doesn't mean OpenAIthropic
    or any of these big dogs or some new company can't come and knock them in the
    face. But what I'm saying is Google has a good lead, a steady lead. They've acquired
    great talent from Open AI, from Windsurf, and all these different other startups.
    And in my humble opinion, if I were to invest in one company saying that this
    is the one that's going to win the AI race, it would be Google. I hope you enjoyed
    this video. I hope you enjoyed this case study. Let me know if you want to watch
    more of these. I know it's a little bit different, but we got to try new stuff.

    much for watching. I'll see you in the next one.

    text: that manufacture the chips. First, we

    text: have Nvidia. And let's be honest, Nvidia
  - start: 00:00:42
    text: is winning. The founders are winning,
  - start: 00:00:44
    text: the stockholders are winning, the
  - start: 00:00:45
    text: employees are winning. Nvidia has a
  - start: 00:00:48
    text: comfortable lead when it comes to chip
  - start: 00:00:50
    text: manufacturing. And they also have a lot
  - start: 00:00:52
    text: of partnerships and they also have the
  - start: 00:00:54
    text: government support which is key when it
  - start: 00:00:56
    text: comes to this whole AI race. And then
  - start: 00:00:58
    text: you have the companies that are serving

  - start: 00:01:01

    text: you the AI models via API. If you've

    text: in my opinion is terrible. Most startups

    text: that I've worked at, actually all

  - start: 00:01:43
    text: have Mistl and all these different labs.
  - start: 00:01:46
    text: We know that the big dogs really
  - start: 00:01:47
    text: competing are OpenAI, Anthropic, and

    text: the UI, the UX that people are using in
  - start: 00:02:49
    text: order to interact with these models,

  - start: 00:02:53
    text: interface itself very popular amongst
  - start: 00:02:56
    text: normies and even us developers. And then
  - start: 00:02:58
    text: you have Enthropics, uh Claude.com. I'll
  - start: 00:03:01
    text: be honest, I barely use it. Um, not like
  - start: 00:03:03
    text: it breaks. Chat Gvt breaks too. They
  - start: 00:03:05
    text: both suck. This is why I use T3 chat. My
  - start: 00:03:07
    text: boy Theo's product. You should check it
  - start: 00:03:09
    text: out if you at all use any of the models
  - start: 00:03:11
    text: for developers. Both open a and

  - start: 00:03:18
    text: developer tooling, right? For like codec
  - start: 00:03:20
