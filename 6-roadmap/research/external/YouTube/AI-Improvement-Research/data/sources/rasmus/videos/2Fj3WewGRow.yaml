  full_text: I'm sure you've heard of the age-old saying, do not judge a book by its
    cover. But unfortunately, when it comes to web and mobile apps, we are 100% judging
    the book by its cover. That's why in today's video, I'm going to be sharing with
    you four component libraries that you can use to build sleek, beautiful applications
    that your users will love and will return and will want to use continuously. Because
    remember, they're going to judge the book by the cover. So, why not make the cover
    beautiful? Sit back, relax. Let's get into it. First UI library is Coconut UI.
    This is a collection of stunning components. And I will say this is one of those
    component libraries that has the unique ones, right? They're like the general
    component libraries that have all the components. There are the blocks templates
    component libraries. And then there's the unique component component libraries.
    And this is one of those. For example, you have the slide text button, which I
    really like. Right? I slide and it says click to see more. And then you have this
    liquid glass music player, right? You can drop this in using their npx command
    or bunx command or you can open this in vzero or straight up just copy the code.
    They also have the Apple activity card, right? The activity rings. If you're on
    the Apple Watch or use the health app, you'll know this component. And this is
    a pretty hard one to build, right? So you can build on top of this component,
    change it up again, npx command or you can copy the code. Uh, coconut UI also
    has beautiful bento grids, right? A nice bento grid on your homepage. It just
    does something, man. So, you can see these nice little animations over here. I
    can see the code. Although, it'd be nice if there was u like highlighting uh syntax
    highlighting, which I'm sure you can add yourself using AI. And then we have card
    flip animates beautifully. Card looks sleek. Oh, this is a good one. The stack
    of cards. You click and the the cards split. You click and then it goes back in
    the order it was. And then you have this component. Say you're building something
    to do with currency transfers, right? You just saw that animation right there.
    Super sleek and clean. Coconut UI also has some AI specific components like an
    input selector uh search. Um you have here like let's say you have some tool calling
    happening. You want to have some loading state in the chat, you can use this um
    you can use this as well. And then they have an AI voice component. Um, 11 Labs
    also has something similar like this. So, you can pick and choose. And you have
    a couple text animations here. One with scroll, typing, matrix, dynamic, the glitch
    effect, shimmer, slice, text, swoosh, and then last but not least, you have this
    profile dropdown from all the components that I like. There's plenty more here.
    Check it out yourself. The link is in the description. Coconut UI. Now, second
    up, we have style UI. It says, create beautiful UI with our blocks and templates.
    But this one is coming soon. Someone very handsome that you may have seen before,
    I'll put his picture right here, is working on this with his team. Expect blocks
    and templates. They're going to be super clean and super fresh. And I can't wait
    for this person again to get them into your hands. But to be on the wait list
    to make sure you're alerted when these drop, make sure to go to styleui.dev and
    enter the weight list. Make sure to follow me on X as well. That's where I'll
    be announcing it. I'm sure you're going to love these ones. Next up, we have Cult
    UI. I don't really feel comfortable with the name, but there are a couple components
    that I found fresh here. The first one being the Family Drawer. Now, if you're
    not familiar with Family, it's this crypto wallet app, but in my opinion, it's
    the most beautifully designed, beautifully architected app ever. The animations
    to the haptic feedback to how the components look, it's an absolutely dream of
    an app. And one of the beautiful things they designed are these drawers that just
    smoothly animate. And Culty has brought these into the web. I particularly like
    the open custom drawer one. That's a really good one. Again, you have the family
    button as well. When you click that, this nicely animates. I really like this.
    You can definitely use this in your web apps. Another cool one that I liked was
    the expandable screen. Say you have a weightless page. You can click get early
    access and it's like a modal that takes over the entire page. user can fill it
    up, then close it. Nicely animates back. Now, another one I really like is the
    browser window. This is a customizable browser window mockup component with support
    for Chrome, Safari, and generic style. So, you can customize how this looks. You
    can make this look like Safari, Chrome. You can specify the URL. You can choose
    to show the address bar. We can make this super small or extra large if you want.
    You can have the sidebar be to the left, to the right. And there are these presets
    as well that you can select. But a really nice and sleek component. Definitely
    something you should add on your web apps. Obviously, if it makes sense. This
    3D carousel of images is pretty cool. And again, just to set this up, all you
    do is copy the command. And if you're building on chat scene, which I'm sure you
    are, you can have this set up easily. And then they have a hover video player
    where you see the component, I can hover over this, and now it becomes a video
    player. This is pretty sleek. I actually like this. I don't like the default video
    player with HTML, uh, the video tag. So, this is a pretty sleek component. And
    then you have the shift card component where if you hover over, you see the image
    shift to the right and then this popup slide beautifully. Again, there are plenty
    of components in cult UI. I'll have the link down in the description below. Check
    it out for yourself. And then we have motion primitives UI kit to make beautiful
    animated interfaces faster. So, there's an emphasis on beautiful motion and animation
    with motion primitives. For example, let's say the animated number. If you want
    to animate some GitHub stars that you want to show off on your page or some dollar
    dollar bills, this is a great component for you to have. You have then the sliding
    number. This is just beautiful stuff. Again, all the code is right there for you.
    Um, we also have the dynamic toolbar where if I click on this, you notice how
    it nicely shifts. Let's click on expandable. If I click on this, you see it expands
    from bottom to top. This again, you can have a nice little toolbar or like even
    a dock using this component. What we're going to do is we're going to click on
    components on the top right and then we're going to click on dock. I really like
    the dock component. You can style this with whatever icons you want, but that
    nice animation as you hover over it is beautiful. You have this glow effect right
    here. You can have it on buttons, but also what I like is let watch this. When
    I click submit, the component glows, right? So, this is something you could do
    with some sort of submission. And then you have this like you can use this as
    like a before and after or you can use this as a like a slider to show like if
    you use my tool this is what it looks like. If you don't this is what it looks
    like. Really sleek and simple. You can also have it on hover. So this is where
    I clicked on the like the line the separator and I'm dragging it. This one I just
    hover and then I when I go left and right it follows. This one sort of has a spring
    motion where like notice how it's bouncy like it catches up. And then you can
    also have a custom slider with this. You can have a progress bar, right? That's
    on the navbar that's on the top. So that show people how much progress they've
    made in reading an article or going through a page. They also have this magnetic
    button where like if I hover over it, it notice how it sort of follows my cursor.
    Um there's also where you can see the text is more so floating in the button.
    Like these little things are just so immaculate and beautiful and they just enhance
    the user experience of your applications. Oh, this is a morphing dialogue. So
    notice how like let's say this is like a notification that pops up. I can click
    on it and that dialogue just animates beautifully. You can have that with images
    as well. You can have this with cards as well. And then you have a morphing popover.
    Let's say you are like editing some settings, a profile setting or whatever it
    is. You can have it just pop up there. Click submit and then it closes back. Here
    it's telling you you can customize the tra transitions however you want. You can
    have a text area pop up. There are just a lot of these primitives that you can
    find with motion primitives that I find super useful when developing web apps.
    And then I noticed when I clicked on IA promptkit.com popped up and this is for
    AI applications. So if you're building an AI app, they have building blocks for
    you to use. Like for example, their chain of thought component where you can show
    how the model is processing the information. You have a chat container here. You
    have code blocks. Again, I'll link all of this stuff in the description down below.
    All this stuff is copy paste for you to use. So please, you have no excuse on
    having ugly looking web applications. You literally have all these component libraries
    linked in the description down below. And again, I want to let you know I will
    be dropping my very own style.dev very soon. Make sure to sign up for the weight
    list link in the descriptions down below. Thank you so much for watching this
    video. Make sure to like, comment, subscribe, hit that notification bell, and
    I'll see you in THE NEXT ONE. PEACE.
