  full_text: I told you so. Everyone doubted Google. I remember when Google dropped
    Bard. Everyone was making fun of them, saying OpenAI is cooking them. They're
    going to lose. It's over. How are you going to bet against a company that has
    infinite money? They have all the best talent in the world. They have chips. They
    got brains. They got YouTube. They got search. They have everything. It was only
    a matter of time before they caught up. And ladies and gents, especially when
    it comes to image gen, Google is in the lead with Nano Banana Pro. This by far
    is the best image model that I've ever witnessed that we've ever witnessed. And
    I'm going to show you examples. I'm also going to share with you mobile apps,
    web apps that you can make using the Nano Banana Pro API because it's available
    now. Let's get straight into the video. So, the best way to test driver or to
    use Nano Banana Pro in my opinion is by going to aistudio.google.com. google.com
    and here's how I tested this image model. There are three types of images I wanted
    to generate. The first one was an infographic. So I prompted here saying create
    an illustration explaining the gospel of Jesus Christ according to the Protestant
    worldview. And when I click on the infographic, this is perfect. it creation in
    the fall, the problem of sin, God's solution, redemption in Christ, salvation
    by grace through faith, the verses, the images, even like the tomb being open
    and the cross and then the bridge. Like this was perfect. Now, how was it able
    to get all the information accurately? I realized in generating the image that
    it searched the internet for relevant information. So, Gemini 3 Pro is multimodal,
    meaning it does images, it does search, it does text, it pretty much does everything.
    the fact that in its image generation it used search to find relevant information
    and used it in my opinion to generate a fantastic infographic. This is 10 out
    of 10. This is test number one. Now test number two is a little bit interesting.
    I saw someone do this on Twitter and I wanted to see for myself. I don't know
    if you've ever tried to go apartment shopping or looking for a house or you're
    trying to rent a place. You're always looking for the layout, right? Because these
    days they make the images look nice. to use the 0.5 zoom on the iPhone or on the
    cameras to make it more spacious than it is. So, I want to look at the layouts,
    but then again, these layouts can't help you envision or dream what your future
    place would look like. So, what I did is I dropped this image and then I prompted
    saying create a 3D rendering of this apartment with furniture and it generated
    this image. So, I can see the bedrooms, I see the kitchen, I see the living area,
    I see the washroom, I see the balcony. And in my opinion, this is an app ID right
    here. So, if you're looking for an app ID and you want to use Nana Banana Pro,
    you can literally use the API, call it uh visualizedreamhouse.com, drop in, people
    can drop in the Zillow listing, you extract the this image right here, and then
    you generate what it looks like. You know what even be cooler? Like, I'm giving
    y'all free ideas. Then you somehow either scrape or if IKEA has an API, you can
    get IKEA furniture, get the images, pass that to Nano Banana Pro and place the
    image in the crib. That's a million dollar idea. I hope you cook with it and if
    you do, send me some money. So, this was pretty cool, but then I wanted it to
    have a little tilt. So, I said, instead of a top- down view, can you have more
    of an angle? And this is when you start to realize Google really is in the lead
    with image gen. And what are our image gen models going to look like next year?
    It cooked with the infographic. it cooked with the 3D render. What about thumbnails?
    As a YouTuber myself, thumbnails being one of the most annoying things to create
    cuz it's literally the one thing that you judge by a video by. You judge this
    video by the cover and in order for you to click it, the thumbnail has to make
    sense. So, I decided to create a thumbnail. I dropped this image in. Now, mind
    you, this this prompt is a really good prompt. And the way I was able to generate
    this prompt is I used Chad GBT to generate this prompt. So, I told Chad GBT, "Generate
    a fire prompt for me in a fire," blah blah blah blah blah. And it it did that
    exactly. And I gave it this image right here. Look at the details. Like, you could
    see the smoke, the char, like the little chest area. It gave me Look, you could
    see how my beard doesn't connect. I wish I wish I wish it connected. That gave
    me some glasses because I asked it to. And then I said, "Can you add text that
    says AI made this using the interbold font and have it on the top right?" And
    then it did that. that I said make the text bigger and it did that. And this right
    now is the thumbnail of the video. This was generated with three prompts. Gents
    and the three ladies that are watching this video, we have on our fingertips the
    greatest image generation model in the world. What are we going to do with it?
    There are many apps you can build with this. There are many niche products you
    can build with this or niche for the weirdos who say that. There are many of these
    products that you can build. But here's the problem. A lot of you probably heard
    me say that and say, "But people can just use the model. People can just go on
    AI Google Studio. True, the developers can, but stop building for developers.
    Unless you're building a dev tool, do not be building for developers. Developers,
    in my opinion, are the worst people to build for. Build for the normies. And when
    I say normies, I mean non-developers, normal people. Believe me, they're not going
    to go on AI Google Studio or AI Studio, whatever they Google calls it, and use
    this to generate images. But if you create this super niche, let's say real estate
    visualizing platform and you again pull that IKEA API or you scrape IKEA, no one's
    going to come to the normies are not going to come to Nano Banana Pro and drag
    the images and do them themselves. But if you create a nice sleek interface, you
    build it properly, it's smooth, it's flawless, it's clean, maybe mobile first,
    so cuz most people are going to be on the phone. I 100% believe there's going
    to be a few of you who are going to make some money if you decide to build something
    with this API and you don't sell to devs, but you sell to normies. That is pretty
    much it for this one. Short and sweet. Nano Banano Pro is the best image gen model.
    Make sure to check it out. Let me know your thoughts in the comments down below.
    Thank you so much for watching. Peace.

  - start: 00:02:27

  - start: 00:02:29
    text: the washroom, I see the balcony. And in
  - start: 00:02:33
    text: my opinion, this is an app ID right
  - start: 00:02:34
    text: here. So, if you're looking for an app
  - start: 00:02:36
    text: ID and you want to use Nana Banana Pro,
  - start: 00:02:38
    text: you can literally use the API, call it
  - start: 00:02:41
    text: uh visualizedreamhouse.com,
