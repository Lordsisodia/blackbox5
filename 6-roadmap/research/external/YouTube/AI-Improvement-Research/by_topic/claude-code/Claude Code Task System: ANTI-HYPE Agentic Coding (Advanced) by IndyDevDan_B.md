# Claude Code Task System: ANTI-HYPE Agentic Coding (Advanced) - Extraction Branch B

**Creator:** IndyDevDan
**Video ID:** 4_2j5wgt_ds
**Branch:** B of 3 parallel extractions
**Status:** PLACEHOLDER - Sub-agent would populate this

## Note

This is a placeholder file. In the full implementation, a sub-agent would:
1. Read the transcript from the video YAML file
2. Run 3-iteration extraction process
3. Save the master document here

## Next Steps

After all 3 branches complete (A, B, C), run the synthesis iteration to:
- Merge unique concepts from all 3 extractions
- Reconcile score differences
- Create unified master document
