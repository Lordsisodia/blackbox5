transcript:
  full_text: So, Cloth Code can now make videos. You tell it what you want in plain
    English, and it creates professional animations from scratch. It's insane. For
    example, this entire video you're watching right now was made just by typing into
    close code. No animations, no touching UI, plain English. Now, you might be thinking,
    "But David, how is this even possible?" Well, all of this is powered by Remotion,
    which lets us create videos programmatically. But now, Remotion has released their
    own agent skills, which means that Cloud Code, Open Code, and other AI agents
    can finally use it. So, in this video, we'll go over what Remotion is, how to
    set up these new agent skills, and how to actually use it for your own AI marketing
    to grow your business. So, make sure to watch until the end. Here's another example
    of what this Remotion skill can do. Now, everything except for the design of the
    characters was generated and stitched together with cloth code. So, this entire
    video you're watching was created with cloth code. someone typing English and
    clothes code designing a video of this video game. Crazy. Here's another example
    that was made with Remotion, Clothe code and anti-gravity. Now, personally, I'm
    not a animator or a designer and doing something like this would take me many,
    many hours because I would first have to learn these softwares. But now, you can
    just type to close code and close code will build it for you. So, not only can
    you use AI to build your product, now you can use AI to market it as well. It
    has never been a better time to start your own business. Okay. So, what is remote?
    What's the thing that makes all of this possible? Well, Remotion is a framework
    for creating videos programmatically using Rust. And the code looks something
    like this. You can think of it as a website that gets recorded frame by frame
    into a video file. So you get the data either from APIs, databases or user input.
    And then each of the render that motion makes produces a unique video automatically.
    Now the reason why AI agents love it is that they are great at writing code. So
    whether it's cloud code, open code or any other coding agent, they already excel
    at writing code. However, these same agents are terrible at using complex graphical
    user interfaces like After Effects, Premiere Pro or any other app designed for
    humans. Remotion fixes this. It turns video creation and animations into React
    components. So all the agents have to do is write a few React components and the
    result is a beautiful looking video or animation. So any of you that are building
    your own app or you have your own business, here is how you could use remotion
    to create product videos. So this is another one built just with cloud code and
    just with a motion. Look at this professional looking animation of email looks
    like Gmail highlighting moving cursor text. You would have to pay thousands of
    dollars to an animator or designer to do this. Now it's just a few prompts to
    glot code with the motion skill. And of course I'm going to show you how to set
    it up later in the video, but I just want to show you how impressive this really
    is. Here's one more example. Now, obviously, this guy gave it these assets, right?
    So, if you have great quality images or assets, it will do even better. But the
    animation cycling between them was built by Remotion. By the way, this agent skill
    came out literally less than 24 hours ago. So, if you want to stay on the cutting
    edge of AI, make sure to subscribe. It takes 2 seconds and it helps out a lot.
    Thank you. Now, let's look at how Remotion works under the hood. The first thing
    you have to understand is the sequence components. And these place elements in
    time, just like in any video editing tool, you have a something like a timeline.
    And each of these are sequence components. Now, when you start your development
    server with npm rundev, you get a local host player, something like this, where
    you can scrap through your video in real time and actually see what the different
    sections look like. And when you're ready and when you want to actually render
    it, each of the frames gets screenshotted and stitched into an MP4 through FFmpeg.
    Now, let's talk about agent skills because this is a relatively new concept that
    most people don't understand. Agent skills are instruction files that teach AI
    coding agents like close code and open code how to work with specific tools. Now,
    the beauty of agent skills is that they use what's called progressive disclosure.
    You don't just dump a bunch of tokens, a bunch of prompts into context window.
    That would be wasteful. Instead, cloth only loads the skills full instructions
    when your task matches its description. So, if your task is about coding, it's
    not going to load the skills about video editing. But if your prompt does mention
    video editing, it will load the skills about video editing. This progressive disclosure
    principle always keeps the context lean. Now skills are an open standard meaning
    it's something like MCPS something that's becoming like the agents.mmd file right
    something that more and more companies and agents are adopting across the whole
    AI ecosystem so today skills work across cloth code agent zero open code and many
    other agents so the big news here is that remotion created their own agent skill
    that you can just plug and play into these agents and have them creating professional
    animations right away. Now, this emotion skill contains all of the API patterns
    for emotion, the different component conventions and best practices for writing
    animations. So, when you ask CL to create a video, it reads these instructions
    and generates proper emotion code. The skill also bundles reference docs for specific
    topics like 3D audio captions. So, Claude only loads whatever it needs for that
    task. And since Remotion is very easy to use because you just type to cloth code
    and cloth code runs the code, people are creating impressive animations on their
    first try, which you're watching right now. This was made with just a couple of
    prompts on the very first try. Now, there are some clear best practices that will
    decide whether you get mediocre results with this skill or whether you get great
    animations from the motion. First off, always start with a clear storyboard. You
    need to describe each scene before prompting cloth. Also, the best results require
    an iterative approach instead of trying to oneshot everything. Start with small
    prompts, see the result, adjust the prompt, so on and so forth. Usually, the best
    motion animations I've seen required five to 10 prompts at least. And pro tip,
    make sure to keep your compositions modular. So, build reusable components for
    intros, transitions, outros. Don't try to put everything into a single component.
    And as I said earlier, give it high quality assets. Right? If you're building
    a video game, give it the sprites. If you're designing a product, give it high
    quality product photos. The better assets you provide, the better the outcome
    will be. And now, let me show you how to actually set this up. First thing we
    have to do is go to remote.dev. So, make sure to click on this u npx create command.
    It will copy it into your clipboard. Then open a terminal and we need to cd into
    a folder where we want to build this. So, let's do cd documents get ls cd into
    David Andre. Boom. All right. I'm going to paste the terminal command in this
    folder. Choose a blank template. Boom. Add tailwind. Yes. Add agent skills. Yes,
    for sure. And there we go. Open a cursor. Yes. There we go. Here's our project
    with a full remote setup. Let me close some of these sidebars that always pop
    up. So, you can see we have everything on the right that we need for a blank motion
    project. And what remains is installing the skill. Now, this is the skills.sh
    page developed by Versel. I'm going to link this below the video, but again, you
    just need to click this to copy the terminal command. Go back to the terminal.
    Type in clear and paste it in. Yes, we want to install this package. There we
    go. We have the skills. Select agents. We're going to use cloth code. And here
    you can select whether you want to install Remotion for just this project or globally.
    It's up to you. Installation method. Let's do Sim. And let's proceed with installation.
    Done. And that's it. The setup is very simple. Again, if you're afraid of using
    the terminal, why? Like, you just copy paste a few commands and it asks you in
    plain English. Don't be afraid of the terminal. It's a limiting belief. In 2026,
    you must be using the terminal to be on the cutting edge of AI. Next up, let's
    go back into our IDE. And then let's open a terminal in this same folder. Type
    in cloth to launch CL code. Give it permissions for this folder. Go. Let me move
    it here. Let's do SLSkill to see if we have available skills. And there we go.
    Project skills. Yes, promotion best practices. Amazing. Let's click escape. So
    now it means that the skill has been successfully installed and cloud code knows
    about it. Now again I would recommend you to create a separate folder a clear
    directory for this. So that's what I did right here. You know I created a motion
    folder with this project folder and everything is happening in here so I'm not
    messing the files all across my computer. I'm going to run it in this folder and
    I'm going to let cloth code cook right here. This is a great practice when working
    with any coding agents. Now when using remotion skill through cloth code, you
    have to remember that animations are created by simple prompts. So make sure to
    use a very detailed prompt and ask cloth to use the remotion skill. So I just
    pasted it as well so that I give Claude context on what you're doing. The next
    thing I would recommend you to do is to ask CL to create a separate subdirectory
    for each animation to keep things organized. So basically you'll have like one
    root folder like this and this shouldn't have any animations right here because
    you'll have multiple subfolders for each of the animations. All right. So clo
    understands it and now it has all the context. So we can start building our first
    animation. So let's create a new folder and I'm going to name it prompts and I'm
    going to create a new file in there named prompt01.md. And this is going to be
    our first prompt. As you can see it's very detailed and that's because I want
    a great result for this animation. So, it's going to be a visual animation in
    the style of free blue, one brown. If you don't know this channel, you're greatly
    missing out. This is one of the best YouTube channels when it comes to math education,
    also some videos on AI, LLM, how does Bitcoin work. Really great channel, and
    it's known for having beautiful animations. So, we're going to use Remotion to
    try to replicate his style. Now, this is a very detailed, obviously written with
    AI as well, but very detailed uh description of what we want to build. So, you
    should be as detailed as possible when using remote. Actually, we can probably
    delete several of these. All right, just cleaned up a bit. I'm going to interrupt
    this. Okay, I'm going to tell it to stop regressing, read prompt 01, and actually
    build it using the remote skills you have. Boom. Enter. As you can see, the prompt
    is 400 lines. Very detailed prompt. And now, let's watch Claude do the magic.
    So, now uh it's asking to use the skill. So, I'm going to select yes. And don't
    ask again because uh I don't need to accept this skill every single time. As you
    can see, it's loading specific things. Animations MD, timing.md, and sequencer
    MD. So it's not loading everything from the skill, only the parts it needs. And
    this is the progressive disclosure, right? This is this is what's keeping the
    context engineering optimal. So now it's creating all subdirectory right here.
    Pythagorean. So there it goes. Clothe code is running the react code for remote.
    So this is uh like 77 lines of code. is 81. It's doing different components. So,
    very nice. One for the animated line, one for triangle, one for square. So, it's
    creating reusable components. That way, we can reuse them. It's in the word opening
    index. It's creating a lot of files. So, I'm interested in this animation. All
    right, let's do npm rundef. See what this looks like. This is the motion UI. So
    far, we don't have anything, but this is what it will look like. It's similar
    to any video editing tool as you can see. Let's go to the main cloth code. Still
    cooking up the animation. 17,000 tokens going for 4 minutes. So the best animations
    take some time. This is not like a single thing that you're going to get like
    in 1 second because keep in mind cloud code has to write hundreds of lines of
    code for these different React components because remote works on React. Oh, there
    we go. Okay, so the main cloud code finally updated root.tsx tsx by registering
    these different components. I like this new cloud code UI. It's very clean. Oh,
    never mind. That's crazy. [laughter] I I complement the new design and it breaks
    completely. Anyways, uh it's removing the unused variables now. So, hopefully
    we won't get any other llinter errors. 10 minutes, guys. 10 minutes for this animation.
    It's pretty insane. Few like cloth core few months ago would never run for 10
    minutes. So, Enthropic is making it less lazy. There is a complete. Okay, let's
    see. All right, there we go. There we go. The Pyan proofs animation is complete.
    Here's what was created. Project structure, main orchestrator, self-drawing lines,
    triangle intro. Okay, let's see. ID by figure and proofs duration 2,400 frames,
    40 seconds at 60 fps. To preview, run npm rundef and select py proofs composition
    in the motion studio. So, let's do that. Let's kill this. Boom. NPM rundev. On
    the left, we have the compositions. Let's select pyan proofs. And as you can see,
    we have a timeline with multiple different sequences. So, let's run it. This is
    pretty nice. Okay, guys. This is this is wild. Let me make this bigger. This is
    actually crazy. Written by cloth code. Imagine having to do this by yourself.
    Doing this manually would take forever. single prompt in plain English. Okay,
    some of these are wrong order obviously but again one prompt this is wild. Okay,
    this is mis a little misaligned but hey nothing you can't fix in future prompts
    and again all of this is code so all of this is programmatic okay so let me give
    you one more example this time with some assets so I'm going to create a new prompt
    new file prompt O2 boom paste it in a little shorter almost 200 this is going
    to be a advertisement for cloth code so I have this u image right here cloth startp
    is just a you a screenshot of the cloud code UI. So I'm going to say read prompt
    O2 and using cloud startup create the animation in remotion. The fewer lines of
    code, the better. Don't want it to be running for 12 minutes again. Let's see
    if it remembers the subfolder directory because that's what we instructed it to
    create subfolders for each. So it moved the PNG file into public. Okay, because
    uh I guess that's where assets go. And now it created the cloth ad subfolder which
    is empty for now. It's going to create the whole folder structure for a motion
    composition. So again inside of the browser you can have different compositions,
    right? This is the default one and this is the pyan proof one. Can split it up
    to 4x and on the sequence below you can like disable different parts, right? So
    maybe you don't want this one. You can hide it. It's a it's a proper video editor.
    like it's not as advanced as Premiere obviously, but uh it's solid. It's solid
    and everything is programmatic. Everything is react code and you can see your
    assets right here. So obviously we have the clo startup file and now we have the
    clo add. So we can see it's being built in real time. Clothe ad is here. Okay,
    let's zoom out to fit. Look at this. Is it finished yet? Okay, this one's faster.
    Okay, 2 minutes composition code add duration 17 seconds. Cursor moves to do terminal
    icon click. Let's look at this. Let's play it in 1x from the beginning. So, we
    have a desktop view here. Make it a bit bigger. So, the term go icon clicks. Okay,
    it didn't click on the terminal. It clicked on the browser, but it opens the terminal.
    It types in cd subscribe to the channel. Very nice. Look at this guys. This is
    crazy. This is all code. This is all animated. Let me replay this. Like doing
    this manually if you're not an animator would take a lot of time. It's a advertisement
    for cloud code in a single prompt less than 2 minutes. Obviously, this one was
    a lot faster than the previous one and it has less detail, but you can follow
    it up. You can say like change the background gradient to be cloud orange color
    instead. Boom. And let's watch it change in real time. There we go. Change the
    clothes code. Already much better. Already feels way more like cloth code. You
    literally animating by typing plain English. If you're not using cloth code in
    2026, you are falling behind. In 2026, you really cannot afford to fall behind.
    Now, if you want to take things to the next level and actually start an AI business
    this year, I made a full video on just on that. It's going to be right here on
    the screen. So go wash it out.
  segments:
  - start: 00:00:00
    text: So, Cloth Code can now make videos. You
  - start: 00:00:02
    text: tell it what you want in plain English,
  - start: 00:00:04
    text: and it creates professional animations
  - start: 00:00:07
    text: from scratch. It's insane. For example,
  - start: 00:00:09
    text: this entire video you're watching right
  - start: 00:00:10
    text: now was made just by typing into close
  - start: 00:00:13
    text: code. No animations, no touching UI,
  - start: 00:00:15
    text: plain English. Now, you might be
  - start: 00:00:17
    text: thinking, "But David, how is this even
  - start: 00:00:19
    text: possible?" Well, all of this is powered
  - start: 00:00:21
    text: by Remotion, which lets us create videos
  - start: 00:00:23
    text: programmatically. But now, Remotion has
  - start: 00:00:25
    text: released their own agent skills, which
  - start: 00:00:27
    text: means that Cloud Code, Open Code, and
  - start: 00:00:29
    text: other AI agents can finally use it. So,
  - start: 00:00:31
    text: in this video, we'll go over what
  - start: 00:00:33
    text: Remotion is, how to set up these new
  - start: 00:00:35
    text: agent skills, and how to actually use it
  - start: 00:00:37
    text: for your own AI marketing to grow your
  - start: 00:00:38
    text: business. So, make sure to watch until
  - start: 00:00:40
    text: the end. Here's another example of what
  - start: 00:00:42
    text: this Remotion skill can do. Now,
  - start: 00:00:44
    text: everything except for the design of the
  - start: 00:00:45
    text: characters was generated and stitched
  - start: 00:00:47
    text: together with cloth code. So, this
  - start: 00:00:49
    text: entire video you're watching was created
  - start: 00:00:51
    text: with cloth code. someone typing English
  - start: 00:00:53
    text: and clothes code designing a video of
  - start: 00:00:55
    text: this video game. Crazy. Here's another
  - start: 00:00:56
    text: example that was made with Remotion,
  - start: 00:00:58
    text: Clothe code and anti-gravity. Now,
  - start: 00:01:00
    text: personally, I'm not a animator or a
  - start: 00:01:02
    text: designer and doing something like this
  - start: 00:01:04
    text: would take me many, many hours because I
  - start: 00:01:06
    text: would first have to learn these
  - start: 00:01:07
    text: softwares. But now, you can just type to
  - start: 00:01:09
    text: close code and close code will build it
  - start: 00:01:10
    text: for you. So, not only can you use AI to
  - start: 00:01:13
    text: build your product, now you can use AI
  - start: 00:01:15
    text: to market it as well. It has never been
  - start: 00:01:17
    text: a better time to start your own
  - start: 00:01:18
    text: business. Okay. So, what is remote?
  - start: 00:01:21
    text: What's the thing that makes all of this
  - start: 00:01:22
    text: possible? Well, Remotion is a framework
  - start: 00:01:24
    text: for creating videos programmatically
  - start: 00:01:26
    text: using Rust. And the code looks something
  - start: 00:01:28
    text: like this. You can think of it as a
  - start: 00:01:30
    text: website that gets recorded frame by

    text: frame into a video file. So you get the
  - start: 00:01:34
    text: data either from APIs, databases or user
  - start: 00:01:37
    text: input. And then each of the render that
  - start: 00:01:39
    text: motion makes produces a unique video
  - start: 00:01:41
    text: automatically. Now the reason why AI
  - start: 00:01:43
    text: agents love it is that they are great at
  - start: 00:01:45
    text: writing code. So whether it's cloud
  - start: 00:01:46
    text: code, open code or any other coding
  - start: 00:01:48
    text: agent, they already excel at writing
  - start: 00:01:50
    text: code. However, these same agents are
  - start: 00:01:53
    text: terrible at using complex graphical user

    text: humans. Remotion fixes this. It turns
  - start: 00:02:02
    text: video creation and animations into React
  - start: 00:02:05
    text: components. So all the agents have to do
  - start: 00:02:07
    text: is write a few React components and the
  - start: 00:02:08
    text: result is a beautiful looking video or
  - start: 00:02:11
    text: animation. So any of you that are
  - start: 00:02:12
    text: building your own app or you have your
  - start: 00:02:14
    text: own business, here is how you could use
  - start: 00:02:15
    text: remotion to create product videos. So
  - start: 00:02:17
    text: this is another one built just with
  - start: 00:02:19
    text: cloud code and just with a motion. Look
  - start: 00:02:21
    text: at this professional looking animation
  - start: 00:02:22
    text: of email looks like Gmail highlighting
  - start: 00:02:25
    text: moving cursor text. You would have to
  - start: 00:02:27
    text: pay thousands of dollars to an animator
  - start: 00:02:29
    text: or designer to do this. Now it's just a
  - start: 00:02:31
    text: few prompts to glot code with the motion
  - start: 00:02:34
    text: skill. And of course I'm going to show
  - start: 00:02:35
    text: you how to set it up later in the video,
  - start: 00:02:36
    text: but I just want to show you how
  - start: 00:02:38
    text: impressive this really is. Here's one
  - start: 00:02:40
    text: more example. Now, obviously, this guy
  - start: 00:02:41
    text: gave it these assets, right? So, if you
  - start: 00:02:43
    text: have great quality images or assets, it
