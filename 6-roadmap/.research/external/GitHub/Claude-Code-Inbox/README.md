## Potential Reallocation Targets

- `.research/external/GitHub/Claude-Code/` - Main topic folder
- `.research/external/GitHub/Agents/` - If agent-focused
- `.research/external/GitHub/Tools/` - If tool-focused
- `.research/_inbox/archived/` - After processing

## Next Steps

- [ ] Review all extracted summaries
- [ ] Identify overlapping patterns
- [ ] Create proper topic folders
- [ ] Move repos to permanent locations
- [ ] Tag with areas/topics in sources.yaml
