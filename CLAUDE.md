# SISO Internal - Blackbox5 Project

This is the SISO Internal project, using Blackbox5 for multi-agent orchestration and project memory management.

## Quick Start

### For Simple Tasks (Claude Code)
- Quick questions: Ask directly
- File edits: Use @file references
- Git operations: Use !git commands

### For Complex Tasks (Blackbox5)
- Multi-agent workflows: "Use Blackbox5 to..."
- Architecture: "Design a system for..."
- Planning: "Create a PRD for..."

## Architecture

- **Engine**: `2-engine/` - Multi-agent orchestration system
- **Memory**: `5-project-memory/siso-internal/` - Project state, decisions, tasks
- **Operations**: `2-engine/07-operations/` - Scripts and workflows

## Current Status

See `5-project-memory/siso-internal/STATE.yaml` for:
- Active tasks
- Active features
- Recent decisions
- GitHub sync status

## Key Files

- `STATE.yaml` - Single source of truth for project state
- `ACTIVE.md` - Dashboard of active work
- `WORK-LOG.md` - Activity log (auto-generated by hooks)
- `feature_backlog.yaml` - Feature queue

## Agent Specialists

Blackbox5 has specialized agents:
- **Amelia 💻** (Developer): Implementation, debugging, testing
- **Mary 📊** (Analyst): Research, analysis, data insights
- **Alex 🏗️** (Architect): System design, architecture, patterns
- **John 📋** (Product Manager): PRDs, epics, requirements

Ask for specific agents by name when needed.

## Memory System

Project memory is organized by question type:
- `decisions/` - Why we're doing it this way
- `knowledge/` - How it works + learnings
- `operations/` - System operations
- `plans/` - What we're building
- `project/` - Project identity & direction
- `tasks/` - What we're working on

## Important Notes

- STATE.yaml is automatically updated via hooks
- All decisions are recorded in `decisions/`
- GitHub sync status is tracked in STATE.yaml
- Session memory is persisted automatically

## Hooks System

This project uses Claude Code hooks for:
- Auto-logging all activity to WORK-LOG.md
- Extracting and persisting memories from sessions
- First principles triggering for complex problems
- Decision capture and validation
- Context boundary detection (prevents overflow)
- Assumption detection and questioning
- Task complexity checking
- Dependency detection
- Knowledge gap detection
- And more...

See `.claude/hooks/README.md` for complete documentation.

## Environment Variables

- `BLACKBOX5_ENGINE_PATH` - Path to Blackbox5 engine (default: ./2-engine)
- `BLACKBOX5_MEMORY_PATH` - Path to project memory (default: ./5-project-memory/siso-internal)
- `BLACKBOX5_CONTEXT_THRESHOLD` - Context usage warning threshold (default: 80)
- `BLACKBOX5_SESSION_TIMEOUT` - Session timeout in seconds (default: 14400 = 4 hours)
