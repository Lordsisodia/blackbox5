## Session Log

### [2026-02-09] Scribe Agent Activation
**Thought:** The user wants comprehensive session documentation. This is a continuous task that runs throughout the session. I need to capture:
- Key decisions made
- Thoughts and reasoning processes
- Learnings and insights
- Agent team activities

**Context:** This appears to be a BB5 (BlackBox5) system session with agent teams. The scribe role is to ensure nothing is lost to the void - every decision, thought, and learning gets persisted.
