## Project Overview

{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}

## Key Context

- **Stakeholders**: See [context/stakeholders.md](context/stakeholders.md)
- **Tech Stack**: See [context/tech-stack.md](context/tech-stack.md)
- **Architecture**: See [context/architecture.md](context/architecture.md)
- **Requirements**: See [context/requirements.md](context/requirements.md)

## Working Patterns

1. **Always check goals.yaml** before starting work
2. **Document decisions** in `decisions/` folder
3. **Capture learnings** in `learnings/` folder
4. **Use tasks folder** for tracking active work
5. **Run context collector** at session start

## BB5 Integration

This project uses the BB5 (BlackBox5) autonomous infrastructure:

- Agent teams activate automatically
- Runs are tracked in `.autonomous/runs/`
- Skills are available via the skill system
- Memory is persisted in `.autonomous/memory/`
