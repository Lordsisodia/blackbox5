## [​](#when-to-use-plugins-vs-standalone-configuration)When to use plugins vs standalone configuration

Claude Code supports two ways to add custom skills, agents, and hooks:

ApproachSkill namesBest for**Standalone** (`.claude/` directory)`/hello`Personal workflows, project-specific customizations, quick experiments**Plugins** (directories with `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`)`/plugin-name:hello`Sharing with teammates, distributing to community, versioned releases, reusable across projects

**Use standalone configuration when**:

- You’re customizing Claude Code for a single project

- The configuration is personal and doesn’t need to be shared

- You’re experimenting with skills or hooks before packaging them

- You want short skill names like `/hello` or `/review`

**Use plugins when**:

- You want to share functionality with your team or community

- You need the same skills/agents across multiple projects

- You want version control and easy updates for your extensions

- You’re distributing through a marketplace

- You’re okay with namespaced skills like `/my-plugin:hello` (namespacing prevents conflicts between plugins)

Start with standalone configuration in `.claude/` for quick iteration, then [convert to a plugin](#convert-existing-configurations-to-plugins) when you’re ready to share.

## [​](#quickstart)Quickstart

This quickstart walks you through creating a plugin with a custom skill. You’ll create a manifest (the configuration file that defines your plugin), add a skill, and test it locally using the `--plugin-dir` flag.

### [​](#prerequisites)Prerequisites

- Claude Code [installed and authenticated](/docs/en/quickstart#step-1-install-claude-code)

- Claude Code version 1.0.33 or later (run `claude --version` to check)

If you don’t see the `/plugin` command, update Claude Code to the latest version. See [Troubleshooting](/docs/en/troubleshooting) for upgrade instructions.

### [​](#create-your-first-plugin)Create your first plugin

1[](#)Create the plugin directoryEvery plugin lives in its own directory containing a manifest and your skills, agents, or hooks. Create one now:CopyAsk AI```

mkdir my-first-plugin

```2[](#)Create the plugin manifestThe manifest file at `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` defines your plugin’s identity: its name, description, and version. Claude Code uses this metadata to display your plugin in the plugin manager.Create the `.claude-plugin` directory inside your plugin folder:CopyAsk AI```

mkdir my-first-plugin/.claude-plugin

```Then create `my-first-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` with this content:my-first-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.jsonCopyAsk AI```

{

"name": "my-first-plugin",

"description": "A greeting plugin to learn the basics",

"version": "1.0.0",

"author": {

"name": "Your Name"

}

}

```FieldPurpose`name`Unique identifier and skill namespace. Skills are prefixed with this (e.g., `/my-first-plugin:hello`).`description`Shown in the plugin manager when browsing or installing plugins.`version`Track releases using [semantic versioning](/docs/en/plugins-reference#version-management).`author`Optional. Helpful for attribution.For additional fields like `homepage`, `repository`, and `license`, see the [full manifest schema](/docs/en/plugins-reference#plugin-manifest-schema).3[](#)Add a skillSkills live in the `skills/` directory. Each skill is a folder containing a `SKILL.md` file. The folder name becomes the skill name, prefixed with the plugin’s namespace (`hello/` in a plugin named `my-first-plugin` creates `/my-first-plugin:hello`).Create a skill directory in your plugin folder:CopyAsk AI```

mkdir -p my-first-plugin/skills/hello

```Then create `my-first-plugin/skills/hello/SKILL.md` with this content:my-first-plugin/skills/hello/SKILL.mdCopyAsk AI```

---

description: Greet the user with a friendly message

disable-model-invocation: true

---

Greet the user warmly and ask how you can help them today.

```4[](#)Test your pluginRun Claude Code with the `--plugin-dir` flag to load your plugin:CopyAsk AI```

claude --plugin-dir ./my-first-plugin

```Once Claude Code starts, try your new command:CopyAsk AI```

/my-first-plugin:hello

```You’ll see Claude respond with a greeting. Run `/help` to see your command listed under the plugin namespace.**Why namespacing?** Plugin skills are always namespaced (like `/greet:hello`) to prevent conflicts when multiple plugins have skills with the same name.To change the namespace prefix, update the `name` field in `plugin.json`.5[](#)Add skill argumentsMake your skill dynamic by accepting user input. The `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder captures any text the user provides after the skill name.Update your `hello.md` file:my-first-plugin/commands/hello.mdCopyAsk AI```

---

description: Greet the user with a personalized message

---

# Hello Command

Greet the user named "$ARGUMENTS" warmly and ask how you can help them today. Make the greeting personal and encouraging.

```Restart Claude Code to pick up the changes, then try the command with your name:CopyAsk AI```

/my-first-plugin:hello Alex

```Claude will greet you by name. For more on passing arguments to skills, see [Skills](/docs/en/skills#pass-arguments-to-skills).

You’ve successfully created and tested a plugin with these key components:

- **Plugin manifest** (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`): describes your plugin’s metadata

- **Commands directory** (`commands/`): contains your custom skills

- **Skill arguments** (`$ARGUMENTS`): captures user input for dynamic behavior

The `--plugin-dir` flag is useful for development and testing. When you’re ready to share your plugin with others, see [Create and distribute a plugin marketplace](/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces).

## [​](#plugin-structure-overview)Plugin structure overview

You’ve created a plugin with a skill, but plugins can include much more: custom agents, hooks, MCP servers, and LSP servers.

**Common mistake**: Don’t put `commands/`, `agents/`, `skills/`, or `hooks/` inside the `.claude-plugin/` directory. Only `plugin.json` goes inside `.claude-plugin/`. All other directories must be at the plugin root level.

DirectoryLocationPurpose`.claude-plugin/`Plugin rootContains only `plugin.json` manifest (required)`commands/`Plugin rootSkills as Markdown files`agents/`Plugin rootCustom agent definitions`skills/`Plugin rootAgent Skills with `SKILL.md` files`hooks/`Plugin rootEvent handlers in `hooks.json``.mcp.json`Plugin rootMCP server configurations`.lsp.json`Plugin rootLSP server configurations for code intelligence

**Next steps**: Ready to add more features? Jump to [Develop more complex plugins](#develop-more-complex-plugins) to add agents, hooks, MCP servers, and LSP servers. For complete technical specifications of all plugin components, see [Plugins reference](/docs/en/plugins-reference).

## [​](#develop-more-complex-plugins)Develop more complex plugins

Once you’re comfortable with basic plugins, you can create more sophisticated extensions.

### [​](#add-skills-to-your-plugin)Add Skills to your plugin

Plugins can include [Agent Skills](/docs/en/skills) to extend Claude’s capabilities. Skills are model-invoked: Claude automatically uses them based on the task context.

Add a `skills/` directory at your plugin root with Skill folders containing `SKILL.md` files:

CopyAsk AI```

my-plugin/

├── .claude-plugin/

│   └── plugin.json

└── skills/

└── code-review/

└── SKILL.md

```

Each `SKILL.md` needs frontmatter with `name` and `description` fields, followed by instructions:

CopyAsk AI```

---

name: code-review

description: Reviews code for best practices and potential issues. Use when reviewing code, checking PRs, or analyzing code quality.

---

When reviewing code, check for:

1. Code organization and structure

2. Error handling

3. Security concerns

4. Test coverage

```

After installing the plugin, restart Claude Code to load the Skills. For complete Skill authoring guidance including progressive disclosure and tool restrictions, see [Agent Skills](/docs/en/skills).

### [​](#add-lsp-servers-to-your-plugin)Add LSP servers to your plugin

For common languages like TypeScript, Python, and Rust, install the pre-built LSP plugins from the official marketplace. Create custom LSP plugins only when you need support for languages not already covered.

LSP (Language Server Protocol) plugins give Claude real-time code intelligence. If you need to support a language that doesn’t have an official LSP plugin, you can create your own by adding an `.lsp.json` file to your plugin:

.lsp.jsonCopyAsk AI```

{

"go": {

"command": "gopls",

"args": ["serve"],

"extensionToLanguage": {

".go": "go"

}

}

}

```

Users installing your plugin must have the language server binary installed on their machine.

For complete LSP configuration options, see [LSP servers](/docs/en/plugins-reference#lsp-servers).

### [​](#organize-complex-plugins)Organize complex plugins

For plugins with many components, organize your directory structure by functionality. For complete directory layouts and organization patterns, see [Plugin directory structure](/docs/en/plugins-reference#plugin-directory-structure).

### [​](#test-your-plugins-locally)Test your plugins locally

Use the `--plugin-dir` flag to test plugins during development. This loads your plugin directly without requiring installation.

CopyAsk AI```

claude --plugin-dir ./my-plugin

```

As you make changes to your plugin, restart Claude Code to pick up the updates. Test your plugin components:

- Try your commands with `/command-name`

- Check that agents appear in `/agents`

- Verify hooks work as expected

You can load multiple plugins at once by specifying the flag multiple times:CopyAsk AI```

claude --plugin-dir ./plugin-one --plugin-dir ./plugin-two

```

### [​](#debug-plugin-issues)Debug plugin issues

If your plugin isn’t working as expected:

- **Check the structure**: Ensure your directories are at the plugin root, not inside `.claude-plugin/`

- **Test components individually**: Check each command, agent, and hook separately

- **Use validation and debugging tools**: See [Debugging and development tools](/docs/en/plugins-reference#debugging-and-development-tools) for CLI commands and troubleshooting techniques

### [​](#share-your-plugins)Share your plugins

When your plugin is ready to share:

- **Add documentation**: Include a `README.md` with installation and usage instructions

- **Version your plugin**: Use [semantic versioning](/docs/en/plugins-reference#version-management) in your `plugin.json`

- **Create or use a marketplace**: Distribute through [plugin marketplaces](/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces) for installation

- **Test with others**: Have team members test the plugin before wider distribution

Once your plugin is in a marketplace, others can install it using the instructions in [Discover and install plugins](/docs/en/discover-plugins).

For complete technical specifications, debugging techniques, and distribution strategies, see [Plugins reference](/docs/en/plugins-reference).

## [​](#convert-existing-configurations-to-plugins)Convert existing configurations to plugins

If you already have skills or hooks in your `.claude/` directory, you can convert them into a plugin for easier sharing and distribution.

### [​](#migration-steps)Migration steps

1[](#)Create the plugin structureCreate a new plugin directory:CopyAsk AI```

mkdir -p my-plugin/.claude-plugin

```Create the manifest file at `my-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`:my-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.jsonCopyAsk AI```

{

"name": "my-plugin",

"description": "Migrated from standalone configuration",

"version": "1.0.0"

}

```2[](#)Copy your existing filesCopy your existing configurations to the plugin directory:CopyAsk AI```

# Copy commands

cp -r .claude/commands my-plugin/

# Copy agents (if any)

cp -r .claude/agents my-plugin/

# Copy skills (if any)

cp -r .claude/skills my-plugin/

```3[](#)Migrate hooksIf you have hooks in your settings, create a hooks directory:CopyAsk AI```

mkdir my-plugin/hooks

```Create `my-plugin/hooks/hooks.json` with your hooks configuration. Copy the `hooks` object from your `.claude/settings.json` or `settings.local.json`, since the format is the same. The command receives hook input as JSON on stdin, so use `jq` to extract the file path:my-plugin/hooks/hooks.jsonCopyAsk AI```

{

"hooks": {

"PostToolUse": [

{

"matcher": "Write|Edit",

"hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "jq -r '.tool_input.file_path' | xargs npm run lint:fix" }]

}

]

}

}

```4[](#)Test your migrated pluginLoad your plugin to verify everything works:CopyAsk AI```

claude --plugin-dir ./my-plugin

```Test each component: run your commands, check agents appear in `/agents`, and verify hooks trigger correctly.

### [​](#what-changes-when-migrating)What changes when migrating

Standalone (`.claude/`)PluginOnly available in one projectCan be shared via marketplacesFiles in `.claude/commands/`Files in `plugin-name/commands/`Hooks in `settings.json`Hooks in `hooks/hooks.json`Must manually copy to shareInstall with `/plugin install`

After migrating, you can remove the original files from `.claude/` to avoid duplicates. The plugin version will take precedence when loaded.
