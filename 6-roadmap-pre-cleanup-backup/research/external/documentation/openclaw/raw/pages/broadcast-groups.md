**Status:** Experimental

**Version:** Added in 2026.1.9

## [​](#overview)Overview

Broadcast Groups enable multiple agents to process and respond to the same message simultaneously. This allows you to create specialized agent teams that work together in a single WhatsApp group or DM — all using one phone number.

Current scope: **WhatsApp only** (web channel).

Broadcast groups are evaluated after channel allowlists and group activation rules. In WhatsApp groups, this means broadcasts happen when OpenClaw would normally reply (for example: on mention, depending on your group settings).

## [​](#use-cases)Use Cases

### [​](#1-specialized-agent-teams)1. Specialized Agent Teams

Deploy multiple agents with atomic, focused responsibilities:

Copy```

Group: "Development Team"

Agents:

- CodeReviewer (reviews code snippets)

- DocumentationBot (generates docs)

- SecurityAuditor (checks for vulnerabilities)

- TestGenerator (suggests test cases)

```

Each agent processes the same message and provides its specialized perspective.

### [​](#2-multi-language-support)2. Multi-Language Support

Copy```

Group: "International Support"

Agents:

- Agent_EN (responds in English)

- Agent_DE (responds in German)

- Agent_ES (responds in Spanish)

```

### [​](#3-quality-assurance-workflows)3. Quality Assurance Workflows

Copy```

Group: "Customer Support"

Agents:

- SupportAgent (provides answer)

- QAAgent (reviews quality, only responds if issues found)

```

### [​](#4-task-automation)4. Task Automation

Copy```

Group: "Project Management"

Agents:

- TaskTracker (updates task database)

- TimeLogger (logs time spent)

- ReportGenerator (creates summaries)

```

## [​](#configuration)Configuration

### [​](#basic-setup)Basic Setup

Add a top-level `broadcast` section (next to `bindings`). Keys are WhatsApp peer ids:

- group chats: group JID (e.g. `[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)`)

- DMs: E.164 phone number (e.g. `+15551234567`)

Copy```

{

"broadcast": {

"[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)": ["alfred", "baerbel", "assistant3"]

}

}

```

**Result:** When OpenClaw would reply in this chat, it will run all three agents.

### [​](#processing-strategy)Processing Strategy

Control how agents process messages:

#### [​](#parallel-default)Parallel (Default)

All agents process simultaneously:

Copy```

{

"broadcast": {

"strategy": "parallel",

"[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)": ["alfred", "baerbel"]

}

}

```

#### [​](#sequential)Sequential

Agents process in order (one waits for previous to finish):

Copy```

{

"broadcast": {

"strategy": "sequential",

"[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)": ["alfred", "baerbel"]

}

}

```

### [​](#complete-example)Complete Example

Copy```

{

"agents": {

"list": [

{

"id": "code-reviewer",

"name": "Code Reviewer",

"workspace": "/path/to/code-reviewer",

"sandbox": { "mode": "all" }

},

{

"id": "security-auditor",

"name": "Security Auditor",

"workspace": "/path/to/security-auditor",

"sandbox": { "mode": "all" }

},

{

"id": "docs-generator",

"name": "Documentation Generator",

"workspace": "/path/to/docs-generator",

"sandbox": { "mode": "all" }

}

]

},

"broadcast": {

"strategy": "parallel",

"[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)": ["code-reviewer", "security-auditor", "docs-generator"],

"[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)": ["support-en", "support-de"],

"+15555550123": ["assistant", "logger"]

}

}

```

## [​](#how-it-works)How It Works

### [​](#message-flow)Message Flow

- **Incoming message** arrives in a WhatsApp group

- **Broadcast check**: System checks if peer ID is in `broadcast`

- **If in broadcast list**:

All listed agents process the message

- Each agent has its own session key and isolated context

- Agents process in parallel (default) or sequentially

- **If not in broadcast list**:

Normal routing applies (first matching binding)

Note: broadcast groups do not bypass channel allowlists or group activation rules (mentions/commands/etc). They only change *which agents run* when a message is eligible for processing.

### [​](#session-isolation)Session Isolation

Each agent in a broadcast group maintains completely separate:

- **Session keys** (`agent:alfred:whatsapp:group:120363...` vs `agent:baerbel:whatsapp:group:120363...`)

- **Conversation history** (agent doesn’t see other agents’ messages)

- **Workspace** (separate sandboxes if configured)

- **Tool access** (different allow/deny lists)

- **Memory/context** (separate IDENTITY.md, SOUL.md, etc.)

- **Group context buffer** (recent group messages used for context) is shared per peer, so all broadcast agents see the same context when triggered

This allows each agent to have:

- Different personalities

- Different tool access (e.g., read-only vs. read-write)

- Different models (e.g., opus vs. sonnet)

- Different skills installed

### [​](#example-isolated-sessions)Example: Isolated Sessions

In group `[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)` with agents `["alfred", "baerbel"]`:

**Alfred’s context:**

Copy```

Session: agent:alfred:whatsapp:group:[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)

History: [user message, alfred's previous responses]

Workspace: /Users/pascal/openclaw-alfred/

Tools: read, write, exec

```

**Bärbel’s context:**

Copy```

Session: agent:baerbel:whatsapp:group:[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)

History: [user message, baerbel's previous responses]

Workspace: /Users/pascal/openclaw-baerbel/

Tools: read only

```

## [​](#best-practices)Best Practices

### [​](#1-keep-agents-focused)1. Keep Agents Focused

Design each agent with a single, clear responsibility:

Copy```

{

"broadcast": {

"DEV_GROUP": ["formatter", "linter", "tester"]

}

}

```

✅ **Good:** Each agent has one job

❌ **Bad:** One generic “dev-helper” agent

### [​](#2-use-descriptive-names)2. Use Descriptive Names

Make it clear what each agent does:

Copy```

{

"agents": {

"security-scanner": { "name": "Security Scanner" },

"code-formatter": { "name": "Code Formatter" },

"test-generator": { "name": "Test Generator" }

}

}

```

### [​](#3-configure-different-tool-access)3. Configure Different Tool Access

Give agents only the tools they need:

Copy```

{

"agents": {

"reviewer": {

"tools": { "allow": ["read", "exec"] } // Read-only

},

"fixer": {

"tools": { "allow": ["read", "write", "edit", "exec"] } // Read-write

}

}

}

```

### [​](#4-monitor-performance)4. Monitor Performance

With many agents, consider:

- Using `"strategy": "parallel"` (default) for speed

- Limiting broadcast groups to 5-10 agents

- Using faster models for simpler agents

### [​](#5-handle-failures-gracefully)5. Handle Failures Gracefully

Agents fail independently. One agent’s error doesn’t block others:

Copy```

Message → [Agent A ✓, Agent B ✗ error, Agent C ✓]

Result: Agent A and C respond, Agent B logs error

```

## [​](#compatibility)Compatibility

### [​](#providers)Providers

Broadcast groups currently work with:

- ✅ WhatsApp (implemented)

- 🚧 Telegram (planned)

- 🚧 Discord (planned)

- 🚧 Slack (planned)

### [​](#routing)Routing

Broadcast groups work alongside existing routing:

Copy```

{

"bindings": [

{

"match": { "channel": "whatsapp", "peer": { "kind": "group", "id": "GROUP_A" } },

"agentId": "alfred"

}

],

"broadcast": {

"GROUP_B": ["agent1", "agent2"]

}

}

```

- `GROUP_A`: Only alfred responds (normal routing)

- `GROUP_B`: agent1 AND agent2 respond (broadcast)

**Precedence:** `broadcast` takes priority over `bindings`.

## [​](#troubleshooting)Troubleshooting

### [​](#agents-not-responding)Agents Not Responding

**Check:**

- Agent IDs exist in `agents.list`

- Peer ID format is correct (e.g., `[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)`)

- Agents are not in deny lists

**Debug:**

Copy```

tail -f ~/.openclaw/logs/gateway.log | grep broadcast

```

### [​](#only-one-agent-responding)Only One Agent Responding

**Cause:** Peer ID might be in `bindings` but not `broadcast`.

**Fix:** Add to broadcast config or remove from bindings.

### [​](#performance-issues)Performance Issues

**If slow with many agents:**

- Reduce number of agents per group

- Use lighter models (sonnet instead of opus)

- Check sandbox startup time

## [​](#examples)Examples

### [​](#example-1-code-review-team)Example 1: Code Review Team

Copy```

{

"broadcast": {

"strategy": "parallel",

"[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)": [

"code-formatter",

"security-scanner",

"test-coverage",

"docs-checker"

]

},

"agents": {

"list": [

{

"id": "code-formatter",

"workspace": "~/agents/formatter",

"tools": { "allow": ["read", "write"] }

},

{

"id": "security-scanner",

"workspace": "~/agents/security",

"tools": { "allow": ["read", "exec"] }

},

{

"id": "test-coverage",

"workspace": "~/agents/testing",

"tools": { "allow": ["read", "exec"] }

},

{ "id": "docs-checker", "workspace": "~/agents/docs", "tools": { "allow": ["read"] } }

]

}

}

```

**User sends:** Code snippet

**Responses:**

- code-formatter: “Fixed indentation and added type hints”

- security-scanner: “⚠️ SQL injection vulnerability in line 12”

- test-coverage: “Coverage is 45%, missing tests for error cases”

- docs-checker: “Missing docstring for function `process_data`”

### [​](#example-2-multi-language-support)Example 2: Multi-Language Support

Copy```

{

"broadcast": {

"strategy": "sequential",

"+15555550123": ["detect-language", "translator-en", "translator-de"]

},

"agents": {

"list": [

{ "id": "detect-language", "workspace": "~/agents/lang-detect" },

{ "id": "translator-en", "workspace": "~/agents/translate-en" },

{ "id": "translator-de", "workspace": "~/agents/translate-de" }

]

}

}

```

## [​](#api-reference)API Reference

### [​](#config-schema)Config Schema

Copy```

interface OpenClawConfig {

broadcast?: {

strategy?: "parallel" | "sequential";

[peerId: string]: string[];

};

}

```

### [​](#fields)Fields

- `strategy` (optional): How to process agents

`"parallel"` (default): All agents process simultaneously

- `"sequential"`: Agents process in array order

- `[peerId]`: WhatsApp group JID, E.164 number, or other peer ID

Value: Array of agent IDs that should process messages

## [​](#limitations)Limitations

- **Max agents:** No hard limit, but 10+ agents may be slow

- **Shared context:** Agents don’t see each other’s responses (by design)

- **Message ordering:** Parallel responses may arrive in any order

- **Rate limits:** All agents count toward WhatsApp rate limits

## [​](#future-enhancements)Future Enhancements

Planned features:

-  Shared context mode (agents see each other’s responses)

-  Agent coordination (agents can signal each other)

-  Dynamic agent selection (choose agents based on message content)

-  Agent priorities (some agents respond before others)
