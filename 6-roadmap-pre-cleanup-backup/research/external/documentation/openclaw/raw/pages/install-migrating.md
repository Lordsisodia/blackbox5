This guide migrates a OpenClaw Gateway from one machine to another **without redoing onboarding**.

The migration is simple conceptually:

- Copy the **state directory** (`$OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR`, default: `~/.openclaw/`) — this includes config, auth, sessions, and channel state.

- Copy your **workspace** (`~/.openclaw/workspace/` by default) — this includes your agent files (memory, prompts, etc.).

But there are common footguns around **profiles**, **permissions**, and **partial copies**.

## [​](#before-you-start-what-you-are-migrating)Before you start (what you are migrating)

### [​](#1-identify-your-state-directory)1) Identify your state directory

Most installs use the default:

- **State dir:** `~/.openclaw/`

But it may be different if you use:

- `--profile <name>` (often becomes `~/.openclaw-<profile>/`)

- `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR=/some/path`

If you’re not sure, run on the **old** machine:

Copy```

openclaw status

```

Look for mentions of `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` / profile in the output. If you run multiple gateways, repeat for each profile.

### [​](#2-identify-your-workspace)2) Identify your workspace

Common defaults:

- `~/.openclaw/workspace/` (recommended workspace)

- a custom folder you created

Your workspace is where files like `MEMORY.md`, `USER.md`, and `memory/*.md` live.

### [​](#3-understand-what-you-will-preserve)3) Understand what you will preserve

If you copy **both** the state dir and workspace, you keep:

- Gateway configuration (`openclaw.json`)

- Auth profiles / API keys / OAuth tokens

- Session history + agent state

- Channel state (e.g. WhatsApp login/session)

- Your workspace files (memory, skills notes, etc.)

If you copy **only** the workspace (e.g., via Git), you do **not** preserve:

- sessions

- credentials

- channel logins

Those live under `$OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR`.

## [​](#migration-steps-recommended)Migration steps (recommended)

### [​](#step-0-—-make-a-backup-old-machine)Step 0 — Make a backup (old machine)

On the **old** machine, stop the gateway first so files aren’t changing mid-copy:

Copy```

openclaw gateway stop

```

(Optional but recommended) archive the state dir and workspace:

Copy```

# Adjust paths if you use a profile or custom locations

cd ~

tar -czf openclaw-state.tgz .openclaw

tar -czf openclaw-workspace.tgz .openclaw/workspace

```

If you have multiple profiles/state dirs (e.g. `~/.openclaw-main`, `~/.openclaw-work`), archive each.

### [​](#step-1-—-install-openclaw-on-the-new-machine)Step 1 — Install OpenClaw on the new machine

On the **new** machine, install the CLI (and Node if needed):

- See: [Install](/install)

At this stage, it’s OK if onboarding creates a fresh `~/.openclaw/` — you will overwrite it in the next step.

### [​](#step-2-—-copy-the-state-dir-+-workspace-to-the-new-machine)Step 2 — Copy the state dir + workspace to the new machine

Copy **both**:

- `$OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` (default `~/.openclaw/`)

- your workspace (default `~/.openclaw/workspace/`)

Common approaches:

- `scp` the tarballs and extract

- `rsync -a` over SSH

- external drive

After copying, ensure:

- Hidden directories were included (e.g. `.openclaw/`)

- File ownership is correct for the user running the gateway

### [​](#step-3-—-run-doctor-migrations-+-service-repair)Step 3 — Run Doctor (migrations + service repair)

On the **new** machine:

Copy```

openclaw doctor

```

Doctor is the “safe boring” command. It repairs services, applies config migrations, and warns about mismatches.

Then:

Copy```

openclaw gateway restart

openclaw status

```

## [​](#common-footguns-and-how-to-avoid-them)Common footguns (and how to avoid them)

### [​](#footgun-profile-/-state-dir-mismatch)Footgun: profile / state-dir mismatch

If you ran the old gateway with a profile (or `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR`), and the new gateway uses a different one, you’ll see symptoms like:

- config changes not taking effect

- channels missing / logged out

- empty session history

Fix: run the gateway/service using the **same** profile/state dir you migrated, then rerun:

Copy```

openclaw doctor

```

### [​](#footgun-copying-only-openclaw-json)Footgun: copying only `openclaw.json`

`openclaw.json` is not enough. Many providers store state under:

- `$OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR/credentials/`

- `$OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR/agents/<agentId>/...`

Always migrate the entire `$OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` folder.

### [​](#footgun-permissions-/-ownership)Footgun: permissions / ownership

If you copied as root or changed users, the gateway may fail to read credentials/sessions.

Fix: ensure the state dir + workspace are owned by the user running the gateway.

### [​](#footgun-migrating-between-remote/local-modes)Footgun: migrating between remote/local modes

- If your UI (WebUI/TUI) points at a **remote** gateway, the remote host owns the session store + workspace.

- Migrating your laptop won’t move the remote gateway’s state.

If you’re in remote mode, migrate the **gateway host**.

### [​](#footgun-secrets-in-backups)Footgun: secrets in backups

`$OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` contains secrets (API keys, OAuth tokens, WhatsApp creds). Treat backups like production secrets:

- store encrypted

- avoid sharing over insecure channels

- rotate keys if you suspect exposure

## [​](#verification-checklist)Verification checklist

On the new machine, confirm:

- `openclaw status` shows the gateway running

- Your channels are still connected (e.g. WhatsApp doesn’t require re-pair)

- The dashboard opens and shows existing sessions

- Your workspace files (memory, configs) are present
