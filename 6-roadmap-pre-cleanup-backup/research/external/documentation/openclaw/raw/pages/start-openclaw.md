OpenClaw is a WhatsApp + Telegram + Discord + iMessage gateway for **Pi** agents. Plugins add Mattermost. This guide is the “personal assistant” setup: one dedicated WhatsApp number that behaves like your always-on agent.

## [​](#-safety-first)⚠️ Safety first

You’re putting an agent in a position to:

- run commands on your machine (depending on your Pi tool setup)

- read/write files in your workspace

- send messages back out via WhatsApp/Telegram/Discord/Mattermost (plugin)

Start conservative:

- Always set `channels.whatsapp.allowFrom` (never run open-to-the-world on your personal Mac).

- Use a dedicated WhatsApp number for the assistant.

- Heartbeats now default to every 30 minutes. Disable until you trust the setup by setting `agents.defaults.heartbeat.every: "0m"`.

## [​](#prerequisites)Prerequisites

- OpenClaw installed and onboarded — see [Getting Started](/start/getting-started) if you haven’t done this yet

- A second phone number (SIM/eSIM/prepaid) for the assistant

## [​](#the-two-phone-setup-recommended)The two-phone setup (recommended)

You want this:

Copy```

Your Phone (personal)          Second Phone (assistant)

┌─────────────────┐           ┌─────────────────┐

│  Your WhatsApp  │  ──────▶  │  Assistant WA   │

│  +1-555-YOU     │  message  │  +1-555-ASSIST  │

└─────────────────┘           └────────┬────────┘

│ linked via QR

▼

┌─────────────────┐

│  Your Mac       │

│  (openclaw)      │

│    Pi agent     │

└─────────────────┘

```

If you link your personal WhatsApp to OpenClaw, every message to you becomes “agent input”. That’s rarely what you want.

## [​](#5-minute-quick-start)5-minute quick start

- Pair WhatsApp Web (shows QR; scan with the assistant phone):

Copy```

openclaw channels login

```

- Start the Gateway (leave it running):

Copy```

openclaw gateway --port 18789

```

- Put a minimal config in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

Copy```

{

channels: { whatsapp: { allowFrom: ["+15555550123"] } },

}

```

Now message the assistant number from your allowlisted phone.

When onboarding finishes, we auto-open the dashboard and print a clean (non-tokenized) link. If it prompts for auth, paste the token from `gateway.auth.token` into Control UI settings. To reopen later: `openclaw dashboard`.

## [​](#give-the-agent-a-workspace-agents)Give the agent a workspace (AGENTS)

OpenClaw reads operating instructions and “memory” from its workspace directory.

By default, OpenClaw uses `~/.openclaw/workspace` as the agent workspace, and will create it (plus starter `AGENTS.md`, `SOUL.md`, `TOOLS.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `USER.md`) automatically on setup/first agent run. `BOOTSTRAP.md` is only created when the workspace is brand new (it should not come back after you delete it).

Tip: treat this folder like OpenClaw’s “memory” and make it a git repo (ideally private) so your `AGENTS.md` + memory files are backed up. If git is installed, brand-new workspaces are auto-initialized.

Copy```

openclaw setup

```

Full workspace layout + backup guide: [Agent workspace](/concepts/agent-workspace)

Memory workflow: [Memory](/concepts/memory)

Optional: choose a different workspace with `agents.defaults.workspace` (supports `~`).

Copy```

{

agent: {

workspace: "~/.openclaw/workspace",

},

}

```

If you already ship your own workspace files from a repo, you can disable bootstrap file creation entirely:

Copy```

{

agent: {

skipBootstrap: true,

},

}

```

## [​](#the-config-that-turns-it-into-“an-assistant”)The config that turns it into “an assistant”

OpenClaw defaults to a good assistant setup, but you’ll usually want to tune:

- persona/instructions in `SOUL.md`

- thinking defaults (if desired)

- heartbeats (once you trust it)

Example:

Copy```

{

logging: { level: "info" },

agent: {

model: "anthropic/claude-opus-4-6",

workspace: "~/.openclaw/workspace",

thinkingDefault: "high",

timeoutSeconds: 1800,

// Start with 0; enable later.

heartbeat: { every: "0m" },

},

channels: {

whatsapp: {

allowFrom: ["+15555550123"],

groups: {

"*": { requireMention: true },

},

},

},

routing: {

groupChat: {

mentionPatterns: ["@openclaw", "openclaw"],

},

},

session: {

scope: "per-sender",

resetTriggers: ["/new", "/reset"],

reset: {

mode: "daily",

atHour: 4,

idleMinutes: 10080,

},

},

}

```

## [​](#sessions-and-memory)Sessions and memory

- Session files: `~/.openclaw/agents/<agentId>/sessions/{{SessionId}}.jsonl`

- Session metadata (token usage, last route, etc): `~/.openclaw/agents/<agentId>/sessions/sessions.json` (legacy: `~/.openclaw/sessions/sessions.json`)

- `/new` or `/reset` starts a fresh session for that chat (configurable via `resetTriggers`). If sent alone, the agent replies with a short hello to confirm the reset.

- `/compact [instructions]` compacts the session context and reports the remaining context budget.

## [​](#heartbeats-proactive-mode)Heartbeats (proactive mode)

By default, OpenClaw runs a heartbeat every 30 minutes with the prompt:

`Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists (workspace context). Follow it strictly. Do not infer or repeat old tasks from prior chats. If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.`

Set `agents.defaults.heartbeat.every: "0m"` to disable.

- If `HEARTBEAT.md` exists but is effectively empty (only blank lines and markdown headers like `# Heading`), OpenClaw skips the heartbeat run to save API calls.

- If the file is missing, the heartbeat still runs and the model decides what to do.

- If the agent replies with `HEARTBEAT_OK` (optionally with short padding; see `agents.defaults.heartbeat.ackMaxChars`), OpenClaw suppresses outbound delivery for that heartbeat.

- Heartbeats run full agent turns — shorter intervals burn more tokens.

Copy```

{

agent: {

heartbeat: { every: "30m" },

},

}

```

## [​](#media-in-and-out)Media in and out

Inbound attachments (images/audio/docs) can be surfaced to your command via templates:

- `{{MediaPath}}` (local temp file path)

- `{{MediaUrl}}` (pseudo-URL)

- `{{Transcript}}` (if audio transcription is enabled)

Outbound attachments from the agent: include `MEDIA:<path-or-url>` on its own line (no spaces). Example:

Copy```

Here’s the screenshot.

MEDIA:https://example.com/screenshot.png

```

OpenClaw extracts these and sends them as media alongside the text.

## [​](#operations-checklist)Operations checklist

Copy```

openclaw status          # local status (creds, sessions, queued events)

openclaw status --all    # full diagnosis (read-only, pasteable)

openclaw status --deep   # adds gateway health probes (Telegram + Discord)

openclaw health --json   # gateway health snapshot (WS)

```

Logs live under `/tmp/openclaw/` (default: `openclaw-YYYY-MM-DD.log`).
