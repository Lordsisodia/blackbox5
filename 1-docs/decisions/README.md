# Decisions

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) and design decisions for the Blackbox5 project.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records capture:
- **Context**: Why a decision was needed
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Consequences**: Trade-offs and impacts

## Naming Convention

Decision files follow the pattern:
```
NNNN-title-in-kebab-case.md
```

Where `NNNN` is a sequential number (e.g., `0001`, `0002`).

## Structure

Each decision should include:
1. **Status**: proposed, accepted, deprecated, superseded
2. **Context**: Background and problem statement
3. **Decision**: The decision that was made
4. **Consequences**: Positive and negative impacts
5. **Alternatives**: Options considered and why rejected

## Current Decisions

## Contributing

When recording a decision:
1. Use the next available number
2. Follow the template structure
3. Link to related decisions
4. Update status when decisions change
