## Purpose

Examples provide:
- Working code to learn from
- Starting points for new projects
- Reference implementations of patterns
- Proof-of-concept demonstrations

## Using Examples

1. Start with basic examples to understand fundamentals
2. Progress through intermediate to advanced
3. Run demos to see the system in action
4. Use as templates for your own implementations

## Contributing

When adding examples:
1. Include a README explaining what the example demonstrates
2. Ensure code is well-commented
3. List prerequisites and setup steps
4. Test that examples run correctly
