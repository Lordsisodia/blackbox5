# Foundations

> Core theoretical foundations of the BlackBox5 system

## Overview

This directory contains the foundational theoretical concepts that underpin the entire BlackBox5 ecosystem. These documents establish the philosophical and architectural principles that guide system design and implementation.

## Key Concepts

- **First Principles Thinking** - Breaking down complex problems to fundamental truths
- **Recursive Improvement** - Self-referential enhancement loops
- **Deterministic Excellence** - Predictable, repeatable high-quality outcomes
- **Emergent Behavior** - Complex patterns arising from simple rules
