> Core concepts and abstractions in BlackBox5

## Overview

This directory contains conceptual documentation explaining the key abstractions, patterns, and mental models used throughout BlackBox5.

## Key Concepts

- **RALF** - Recursive Autonomous Learning Framework
- **Dual-Agent System** - Separation of planning and execution concerns
- **Context Windows** - Managing limited attention effectively
- **Task States** - Pending → In Progress → Complete
- **Feedback Loops** - Continuous improvement cycles
