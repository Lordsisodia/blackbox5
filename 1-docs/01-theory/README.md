## Purpose

The theory section provides the intellectual foundation for implementation decisions. Before building, we understand:
- Why certain patterns are chosen
- What problems we're solving
- How agents should behave
- What trade-offs exist

## Contributing

When adding new theoretical content:
1. Place research in the appropriate subsection
2. Link to related implementation docs in `02-implementation/`
3. Include references and sources where applicable
