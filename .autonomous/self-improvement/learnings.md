# BlackBox5 Self-Improvement Learnings

This document captures patterns, insights, and learnings from autonomous self-improvement runs.

## Format

For each significant learning, use this format:

```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD] - [Learning Title]

**Context:** What led to this learning
**Observation:** What was observed
**Action Taken:** What was done
**Result:** Outcome of the action
**Confidence:** How confident are we (High/Medium/Low)
**Repeatability:** Will this work again? (Yes/No/Maybe)
**Key Insight:** The distilled wisdom
```

## Learnings Log

*This section will be populated by the autonomous improvement agent as it discovers patterns.*

## Improvement Patterns That Work

Based on historical success rates:

| Category | Success Rate | Frequency | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-----------|-------|
| task_cleanup | TBD | TBD | Moving stuck tasks |
| log_rotation | TBD | TBD | Archiving old logs |
| error_detection | TBD | TBD | Investigating errors |

---

## Improvement Patterns to Avoid

| Category | Failure Rate | Reason |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| TBD | TBD | TBD |

---

## Scoring Calibration

Current scoring formula:
```
Score = (Impact * 10) + (Frequency * 5) - (Effort * 3) - (Risk * 5)
```

**Thresholds:**
- Score >= 30: Execute immediately
- Score >= 15: Execute if time permits
- Score < 15: Add to backlog

**Adjustments made over time:**
*None yet - system is learning*

---

## Safety Rules Evolution

**Initial safety rules:**
- ALWAYS Safe: Move tasks, update docs, log rotation
- ASK First: Core engine changes, auth changes, schema changes
- NEVER: Delete without rollback, modify binaries, change SSH keys

**Based on failures:**
*None yet - system is learning*

---

## System Trends

**Error Rate Over Time:**
*TBD - need more data*

**Task Backlog Over Time:**
*TBD - need more data*

**Improvement Success Rate Over Time:**
*TBD - need more data*

## Recommendations

**For Human Review:**
- Review learnings weekly
- Adjust scoring thresholds monthly
- Update safety rules as needed
- Validate autonomous changes

**For Agent Adjustment:**
- Tune scoring based on actual results
- Add new improvement patterns
- Update risk assessments
- Refine execution strategies
