# RALF Environment Variables
# ==========================
# Copy this file to your project root and rename to .env
# Then modify the paths for your specific project.

# Primary Configuration
# ---------------------
# Path to your project directory (where tasks, runs, etc. are stored)
RALF_PROJECT_DIR=~/.blackbox5/5-project-memory/blackbox5

# Path to the RALF engine directory
RALF_ENGINE_DIR=~/.blackbox5/2-engine

# Project name (used for organizing tasks)
RALF_PROJECT_NAME=blackbox5

# BlackBox5 Root (optional - affects all BB5 paths)
BLACKBOX5_HOME=~/.blackbox5

# Alternative Environment Variables (also supported)
# --------------------------------------------------
# These are legacy variables that RALF also recognizes
BB5_PROJECT_ROOT=~/.blackbox5/5-project-memory/blackbox5
BB5_ENGINE_ROOT=~/.blackbox5/2-engine
BB5_HOME=~/.blackbox5
BB5_PROJECT=blackbox5

# Usage
# -----
# 1. Copy this file: cp .env.example .env
# 2. Edit .env with your project paths
# 3. Source it: source .env
# 4. Run RALF scripts - they will use your configured paths
#
# Or set variables inline:
#   RALF_PROJECT_DIR=/my/project ralf-scout
#
# Or export them in your shell profile:
#   export RALF_PROJECT_DIR=/my/project
